露丝 我对卡尔的事
感到非常遗憾。
Ruth, I'm so sorry
about Cal.

306
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:20,067
-你们得把鲍比·贝恩
带回来问话。
-You need to bring in
Bobby Bain.

307

-为什么？
-Okay, why?

308
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:23,367
-因为他昨晚

-Because he was
with Cal last night.

309
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,767
-他们在农场喝酒。
-They were drinking
at the farm.

310

-不只是喝酒。
听着...

316

-我今早才看到留言。
-I didn't pick it up
until this morning.

317

鲍比的某些事，
Point is, Cal found out
something about Bobby,

318
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,700
而且我们询问时
鲍比表现得很可疑。
and Bobby was shifty
when we spoke to him.

你没听到留言吗？
Did you not hear
the message?

-That's it?
That's all you've got?

-Well, he's got a point.
It's not much.

-这些药片来自阿伯丁。
-The pills are sourced
in Aberdeen.

我在缉毒队的线人证实了这点。

I -- I didn't want her upset.

1027
00:53:55,367 --> 00:53:56,833
-然后你怎么做的？
-So, what did you do?

1028
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,700
-答应明早想办法筹钱给她
-I told her I'd try and get her
some in the morning.

1029
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:01,733
然后她就走了
And then she left.

1030
00:54:05,133 --> 00:54:09,367
-你说过艾伦想揭露阿克马尔真相
-You told me Ellen wanted
to tell the truth about Akmal.

1031
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,733
-我们都想 -但希瑟阻止了你们？
-We all did.
-But Heather stopped you?

1032
00:54:11,867 --> 00:54:13,100
-对
-Yes.

1033
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:15,800
-可如果艾伦真站出来
-Still, if Ellen did choose
to come forward,

1034
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:17,967
会是个大麻烦
that would be a problem.

1035
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,433
-我没杀艾伦
-I didn't kill Ellen.

1036
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:23,733
-我不信你 阿齐尔
-I don't believe you, Azir.

1037
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:30,067
如果艾伦来过又离开
You see, if Ellen turned up
at your house and then left,

1038
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:33,067
为何证据显示她上过你的车？
how come we have evidence
that she was in your car?

1039
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,833
她威胁要揭发阿克马尔对吧？
She threatened to tell the truth
about Akmal, didn't she?

1040
00:54:35,967 --> 00:54:38,567
告诉你她准备站出来作证
She told you she was
going to come forward.

1041
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,900
-没有
-No.

1042
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:41,433
-她就站在你家门口
-And there she was,
on your doorstep,

1043
00:54:41,567 --> 00:54:42,833
威胁你的家人 -我没杀人
threatening your family.
-I didn't kill her.

1044
00:54:42,967 --> 00:54:44,867
-那她怎么上的你车？！
-Then how did she get
into your car?!

1045
00:54:45,067 --> 00:54:48,533
-因为我担心她！
-Because I was worried
about her!

1046
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:51,533
那么晚 她独自一人
It was late.
She was on her own.

1047
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:53,333
她走后我开车追了上去
When she left,
I drove after her.

1048
00:54:53,467 --> 00:54:54,767
-你追她？
-You chased after her?

1049
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,067
-只是想确保她安全
-To -- to make sure
she was okay.

1050
00:54:57,167 --> 00:54:59,167
追上后让她上了车
I caught up with her.
Told her to get in.

1051
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,067
-她答应了吗？
-是的。
-And did she?
-Yes.

1052
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:02,833
-后来发生了什么？
-And then what happened?

1053
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,567
-我问她想去哪里。
-I asked her where
she wanted to go.

1054
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,567
我说可以带她去任何地方。
I told her
I'd take her anywhere.

1055
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,067
-她想去哪里？
-Where did she want to go?

1056
00:55:11,233 --> 00:55:13,533
艾泽尔。
Azir.

1057
00:55:13,667 --> 00:55:16,967
你把艾伦带去哪儿了？
Where did you take Ellen?
