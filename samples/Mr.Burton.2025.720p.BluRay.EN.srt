<i>The raids, which lasted

<i>that our bombers attacked
industrial targets there</i>

13
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,268
Spring, Mr Burton I had been
thinking to give up on it.

14
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:18,375
Yes, Ma Yes, indeed.

15
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,435
Will you be writing this morning?

16
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,143
Certainly, that is my plan.

17
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:29,292
Oh Then I shall keep <i>sotto voce.</i>

18
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:37,518
Do you have everything
you need, Mr Burton?

19
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:40,935
Yes Yes, thank you, Ma.

20
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,250
OK

21
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:11,459
Slowly! Slowly

<i>? All things wise and wonderful</i>

25
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,143
Good morning, Mr Burton.

- Where is Mr Drisco"?
- He's sick, sir.

33
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:54,268
Sick? We", that explains something.

34
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:56,018
Uh, Evans?

35
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:58,268
How many Es in "elementary"?

00:03:58,292 --> 00:03:59,351
Uh, three, sir.

That's mine, sir

42
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,643
Jenkins, we may not
judge a book by its cover,

43
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:20,560
but we cannot judge a book
with no cover at a...

44
00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:23,018
If a national paper shortage

45
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:25,185
cannot persuade you to look after them,

46
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:27,625
I shall have to persuade you myself.

47
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:33,435
<i>Henry V,</i> Prologue "O for a Muse of fire".

But, sir, it's
the Neath game tomorrow.

"O for a Muse of fire."

54
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:51,292
What <i>is</i> a muse?

55
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,351
- Anyone?
- A poet's bit of skirt

56
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:06,726
In a year and three months' time,

57
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,834
most of you will be in uniform.

58
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,143
Some of you may be asked
to go out and ki",

59
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:18,667
and may face death yourselves Why?

60
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,518
We", I shall tell you You will be fighting

61
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:29,560
for what is good and right and beautiful,

62
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:36,393
"and this is the essence
of a" those things.

63
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:37,726
Picture the scene.

64
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:43,393
Agincourt On one side,
the English and the Welsh.

65
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:46,310
King Henry and Fluellen.

66
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:52,226
And on the other,
a force five times our strength.

67
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:58,042
The French with their banners
and horses and spears.

68
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:02,459
"God's arm strike with us!"

69
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:06,417
"'Tis a fearful odds."

70
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,167
But wait.

71
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,518
Wait.

72
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:14,476
Then

73
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,209
a single arrow flies!

74
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,893
Are you quite sure, Mr Burton?

75
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:12,310
Please don't come on my account.

76
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:14,226
In the absence of a theatre, Ma,

77
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,893
there's nowhere I would rather be

78
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,500
<i>Fine work, Hirth.</i>

79
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:30,542
<i>Magnificent, Herr Kommandant.</i>

80
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,792
<i>So, the curtain rises on Canada</i>

81
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,476
<i>Heavy new blows</i>

82
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,768
<i>have fallen on the Italian
navy and merchant fleet</i>

83
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:54,185
<i>in their home waters,</i>

84
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:56,185
<i>as well as in the central Mediterranean</i>

85
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,810
<i>and off the coast of North Africa.</i>

86
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:01,042
<i>Most of the credit
goes to our submarines</i>

fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus".

89
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,226
If you say so, Mr Burton

90
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,310
I'd like a word
with your openside, Mr David,

91
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:40,518
if you don't mind Just for a moment

92
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:43,417
Come on, boys!

93
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:49,935
Push, push, push Get it

94
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:53,834
"We" played.

95
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,226
- What happened to you?
- Mr Burton

96
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,000
I was expecting you at half past three.

97
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:08,851
I did wait for you, sir, I did - Ah.

98
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,351
Are you suggesting <i>I</i> was late?

99
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,375
We", it's the truth.

100
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,875
"Then you'" know the Prologue, of course.

101
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:21,935
"O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend

102
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,875
the brightest heaven of invention".

103
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:27,018
"A kingdom for a stage, princes to act

104
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:29,500
and monarchs to behold
the swelling scene".

105
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:34,875
"Then should the warlike Harry,
like himself

106
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,476
assume the port of Mars,
and at his heels".

107
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,810
Fine - "Leash'd in like hounds,

108
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:40,393
should famine, sword and fire".

109
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:41,726
Thank you, Jenkins

110
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,875
I can do it all, sir.

111
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,750
"No, no, that'" do.

112
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes, sir.

113
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:51,167
It's not much of a punishment,
to be honest with you.

114
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,417
I bloody loved it

115
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:30,101
I am the ghost of Taibach future.

116
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,500
Come into my arms, little one.

117
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:35,435
Ah

118
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:40,685
- What are you doing here?
- Homework.

119
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,667
Hmm See you later

120
00:10:57,084 --> 00:10:58,875
Where the hell have you been again?

121
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,584
Why? What's it to you?

122
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,101
School ended at half past three
this afternoon

123
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,893
If you think I'm going to spend
the rest of my life

124
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,310
slaving down that blasted hole

125
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:17,726
so you can have - So what?

126
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,542
You're going to throw me out, are you?

127
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:23,143
Let me tell you.

128
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,101
If your father was less of a drunkard.

129
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,393
Don't you dare Don't you bloody dare

130
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:28,584
Richie

131
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:53,667
Homework?

132
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:57,000
I brought you some cocoa.

133
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:02,584
<i>Diolch.</i>

134
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:13,226
Don't think too badly of him,
Richie He's worried, is a...

135
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,834
His chest.

136
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:18,417
That's two shifts
he's had to miss this week.

137
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,351
I'" go back to Ponty
That'd be the best thing.

138
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,810
"Dad'" have me One less mouth
for Elfed to worry about

139
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:29,851
Richie, don't be daft.

140
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,060
There's two to a bed in Ponty as it is.

141
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,334
How would you get to school?

142
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,726
Just try to keep your head down a bit.

143
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,500
Do your homework, play your rugby.

144
00:12:45,584 --> 00:12:47,750
Just make something of yourself

145
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,893
Ah.

146
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:17,393
One of yours, Mr Burton?

147
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:20,000
No, Ma, not one of mine.

148
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:24,185
The BBC have given me
some more production work.

149
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:26,042
Oh.

150
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:31,084
We", perhaps not a bad thing,
just at the moment.

151
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,476
I wonder if it wouldn't do you good

152
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,084
to look outward for a time.

153
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:40,268
You are right, Ma, as you ever are.

154
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:43,334
It is spring, after all.

155
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:48,810
Still it is the theatre that I miss.

156
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:49,893
Hmm.

157
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:51,875
There is nothing to replace it - No.

158
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:54,935
Not the wireless, not the cinema.

159
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,351
No.

160
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,935
We used to put on plays
when I was a girl at the YMCA.

161
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:03,834
Oh, I did love those It was
such a nice little stage.

162
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:08,875
Ma, how long
have I lodged here with you?

163
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:11,935
Twelve years, or 15?

164
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:15,851
And you have never before
told me that you are an actress?

165
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,768
Oh No, I

166
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,101
I'm quite sure I was terrible

167
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,393
We", you must tell me, who did you play?

168
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:25,560
Well, oh

169
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:28,101
Well, I did play Juliet once.

170
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:32,875
Ma! I curse the day
that I missed your Juliet!

171
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:34,917
Oh, Mr Burton

172
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,875
Aye, anyway, Libretto,
the horse was called, man.

173
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,875
And damn me if he didn't bloody win.

174
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:14,226
You can say what you like
about gambling, boys,

175
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,310
but I haven't seen more money
in a single place to this day.

176
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,435
Never mind a round My father
must have bought a drink

177
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:23,268
for every man in Pontrhydyfen

178
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,143
So, of course, come stop-tap,

179
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:30,351
it fell to me to wheel the
bugger back home up the hi...

180
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,060
And an heroic climb it was,
I'm telling you.

181
00:15:33,084 --> 00:15:34,560
By the time we reached his gate,

182
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:36,310
I was blowing like a winding engine.

183
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:38,768
"Never forget the brakes
on a wheelchair, boys"

184
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,125
Huh?

185
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:48,709
Oh.

186
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:53,435
Our Richie

187
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,143
Jeanie, get a pint for the boy

188
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,351
and I'll have another one myself

189
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,476
We" now, <i>bachan, bachan.</i>

190
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,417
That's the kind of interruption I like.

191
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:07,810
Where was I, then? Aye.

192
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,084
Never forget the brakes on a wheelchair.

193
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,851
There's a lesson for you now

194
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,268
I stopped for a minute to catch my breath.

195
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:16,810
The next thing I know,

196
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,935
the old man was careering down the hi",

197
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,476
shouting and screaming

198
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,393
and beating the side of his wheelchair,

199
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:26,518
"Come on, Libretto Come on"

200
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:28,393
"Come on."

201
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:31,167
The speed he was going I tell
you, I shall never forget.

202
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:33,101
"Come on, Libretto."

203
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,351
Down Station Road, past Dan-Y-Bont,

204
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,310
and I heard him one last time, "Libretto".

205
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:39,542
And whack.

206
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:44,709
Old Thomas met the pillar
of the aqueduct.

207
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:48,125
Killed him stone dead

208
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:57,042
Bloody true,
boys, bloody true!

209
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:07,768
Oh Mr Burton It's on.

210
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:10,292
Elgar

211
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:28,750
George never liked him
I could never understand it.

212
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,750
George was wrong, Ma.

213
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,334
Simple as that

214
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:07,226
No room at the inn

215
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:50,875
Still with us, is it?

216
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:53,917
I expected you would be

217
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:58,000
I've got some news for you, I have.

218
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,417
I found you a job.

219
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:04,226
Elfed, what are you talking about?

220
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,518
One pound eight a week
Good position One for life.

221
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:11,685
He's at school You know he can't work.

222
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:15,101
When I was his age, I'd been
working for three years,

223
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,560
six days a week.

224
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:18,310
But, Elfed

225
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:23,000
I can't Next year, I've got
the School Certificate.

226
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:29,560
I shan't have this family
falling short any longer.

227
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:31,709
He's not going down the mine.

228
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,792
No No, he's not.

229
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:37,792
A job has come up at the Co-op.

230
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:40,875
Haberdashery department

Please sit down.

242
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:25,500
Have we mislaid Mr Jenkins?

243

Left he has, sir.

244
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,935
Oh, really? I was not informed.

245
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:35,834
We", we shall have
to try to survive without him.

246
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:40,518
A new half-term is upon us

247
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:43,476
and we must address ourselves
to the Gothic.

248
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,601
In the shape of <i>The Castle of Otranto.</i>

249
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:50,667
Haunted passageways,
horrid, inexplicable.

250
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:01,726
No Not that way.

251
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,875
Dear me, how many times
do I have to show you?

252
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:05,792
Take both shoulders.

253
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:12,417
Now lift up the collar
and flatten the lapel.

254
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:16,084
The lapel Do you even know
what a lapel is?

255
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:20,459
For.

I heard your play the other
night, on the wireless.

295
00:24:10,084 --> 00:24:12,018
Oh?

00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,435
Jenkins.

299
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:36,018
If you're interested in the theatre,

300
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:42,393
I have recently started
a dramatic society at the YMCA

301
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:44,851
where you'd be very welcome.

302
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:49,435
You're putting on plays then,
sir, are you? Like at school?

303
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:50,625
Yes.

Ah, yes, that is good, sister,
to think of that.

306
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,435
But, I, uh, I don't want to sell them.

307
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:14,250
You see, my mother gave
them to me on her deathbed.

308
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:18,726
Jenkins.

309
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,667
Ah, come in Come in.

You auditioning then, are you?

00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:37,268
I thought I'd give it a go, see.

315
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:43,768
So, Jenkins, we're reading
sections of our play,

316
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,667
<i>The Bishop's Candlesticks.</i>

317
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:51,476
And, uh, we", why don't you
jump right in?

318
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,893
We need someone to play our Convict.

319
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:57,810
Um, Convict begins on page nine,
is it, Baynham?

320
00:25:57,834 --> 00:26:00,060
Uh, yes, top of page nine, sir.

321
00:26:00,084 --> 00:26:04,601
Now, Jenkins,
the Convict is a fugitive.

322
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:07,310
And he's starving.

323
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:10,101
And he is armed with a knife

324
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:12,459
as he comes into the Bishop's house.

325
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:15,060
Yes, sir.

326
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:17,601
Don't worry Just just give it a go.

327
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:20,726
Right The clock strikes 12

328
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,268

329
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:25,018

00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:41,518
If you call out, you are a dead man!

335
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:44,875
But, my friend, as you see, I am reading.

336
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:48,393
Why should I call out?
Can I help you in any way?

337
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:49,851
I want food I'm starving

338
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,643
I haven't eaten anything in three days.

339
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:53,435
Give me food quickly Quickly, curse you.

340
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:56,935

00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,935
Um, I'm wondering.

342
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:01,125
If he's desperate, uh

343
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:05,018
he doesn't want to be discovered.

344
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:08,792
Maybe we could try him, uh

345
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,310
Quieter?

346
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:15,417
Quieter Good idea

347
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:24,310

360
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:44,435
Oh I'm not supposed to say that, am I?

361
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:54,500
We only paid for standing.

362
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:11,500
My father's coming tonight, he is.

363
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:16,334
Don't say anything more Kiss
me and give me your blessing.

364
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:19,476
I'm going to bed

365
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,385
If you call out,
you are a dead man!

366
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,042
- Line?
- My friend.

367
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:35,935
My friend, as you see, I am reading.

368
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:39,000
Why should I call out?
Can I help you in any way?

369
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,851
I want food I'm starving

370
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,875
I haven't eaten anything in three days.

371
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:51,810
Give me food Quickly, curse you.

372
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:54,768
But, certainly,
my son, you shall have food

373
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,226
I will ask my sister
for the keys of the cupboard.

374
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,584
Sit down.

375
00:30:03,209 --> 00:30:04,834
I have a wolf inside me

376
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:09,000
tearing at my entrails.

377
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:12,917
Tearing me apart

378
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,185
We thought you was wonderful,
Richie, wonderful!

379
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:31,834
It weren't so bad, was it?

380
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,459
- Where's Daddy?
- Got held up, I expect.

381
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:39,060
Right.

382
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:40,750
Mrs Jenkins?

383
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,935
Mrs James, Mr Burton.

384
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:46,435
This is my husband, Mr Elfed James

385
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:48,935
I'm Richie's sister
He lives with us, you see.

386
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:51,393
Oh - How do you do?

387
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:54,893
How do you do? Well,
you should be very proud

388
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:57,935
Richard excelled himself this evening

389
00:30:57,959 --> 00:31:00,101
I'm only sorry he's no longer
attending school.

390
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:03,310
He did love your lessons, Mr Burton.

391
00:31:03,334 --> 00:31:05,310
Always on about them, he was.

392
00:31:05,334 --> 00:31:07,310
Well, if there's anything I can do

393
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:09,560
Richard is an intelligent boy.

394
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:12,500
He could do a lot better
than working in that shop.

395
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:21,875
I-I-I do understand these
are hard times for everyone,

396
00:31:22,042 --> 00:31:25,893
but it might be possible to have
him reinstated in school

397
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:31,893
I heard the applause Bloody marvelous

398
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:33,643
Tremendous.

399
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,893
Please excuse me, Mr Burton
and thank you, again.

400
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:38,101
Thunderous, it was A mighty roar

401
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,226
I could hear it out here!

402
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:47,709
Come on.

403
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:55,601
"These are hard times
for everyone"

404
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,185
I knew what he meant.

405
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:59,185
Like I've not done and supported that boy

406
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,393
since he was two years old.

407
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:02,185
He's willing to give Richie
another chance.

408
00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:04,768
The boy's had chances
up to his eyeballs, man

409
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,060
I mean, what about us?

410
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:07,726
What about those who has to carry him?

411
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,101
He's an important man

412
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:11,018
Call that sort a man, do you?

413
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:12,101
Elfed.

414
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:15,393
All right Give me one good
reason why I should help him.

415
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:17,310
When has he ever helped me? Or you?

416
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:20,060
Cos no one in this family has
ever finished their education.

417
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:21,792
Not one of us, never.

418
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:27,417
Elfed.

419
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:31,685
It's one more year
Not even that, ten months.

420
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:34,334
Then he' " be ca" ed up to
the forces, like it or not.

421
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,292
"You'" never have to support him again.

422
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,500
The boy has to pay his way.

423
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:46,643
What if I paid my way
and went to school?

424
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:48,518
I'd believe that when I saw it

425
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:50,250
I could do it, I could, honest.

426
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,625
I can't stand the Co-op no more, see? I

427
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:58,084
I'll do anything, I will I promise.

428
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:04,250
Then prove it.

429
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:11,792
Ta-ra then

430
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,268
Good work, you

431
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,393
See you tomorrow

432
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:41,060
I think Jenkins has
a strong case for reassessment

433
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:45,226
I believe he shows considerable
intellectual promise.

434
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,875
It's very unusual that
a reinstatement will be awarded.

435
00:33:49,042 --> 00:33:53,875
But it is our job
to assess a child's potential,

436
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:56,185
not judge him by his past.

437
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:58,185
Haven't got any old papers
for us, have you?

438
00:33:58,209 --> 00:33:59,750
Let me have a look, now.

439
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:02,209
Here we are

440
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:10,435
Sixty-three papers I got for
you, Edith Two up on last week.

441
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:11,893
How much do you want for them, then?

442
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,167
Shilling?

443
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:22,875
Jenkins has told me that
it is his ambition, long held,

444
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:25,018
to become a teacher himself.

445
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:28,542
To give back to the community
that has supported him.

446
00:34:29,459 --> 00:34:33,018
<i>I believe that what Jenkins will gain</i>

447
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:37,893
from completing his education
will be repaid many times over,

448
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:41,060
to the benefit of this town
for generations to come.

449
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:49,709
If you'd like to wait outside,
we can make a decision.

450
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:53,834
Thank you

451
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:10,018
Morning, Mr Burton.

452
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:12,060
Good morning, everyone.

453
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:16,459
And, uh, welcome back, Jenkins.

454
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:19,125
Sir

455
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:46,875
We", we", we"I Jenkins on fire watch.

456
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:50,542
Jolly good.

457
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,042
What are you reading?

458
00:35:57,709 --> 00:36:00,042
James Joyce, it is, sir - Oh, yes?

459
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,601
Ah.

460
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:08,643
Not the best advertisement for
the Irish educational system.

461
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,875
I wanted the chance to

462
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,917
well, thank you properly, I did
For getting me back into school.

463
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:30,000
"Just pass your exams
That's a" the thanks I ask.

464
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:37,935
If there is one thing to be said
for the blackout,

465
00:36:37,959 --> 00:36:39,625
it's the clarity of the skies.

466
00:36:41,084 --> 00:36:45,000
Look See Mars setting?

467
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:49,417
- There's a flicker of red?
- Yeah.

468
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,042
You know.

469
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:58,351
I once spent a night under
the stars in the Mojave Desert.

470
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:01,000
The Mojave Desert? In California?

471
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:06,542
Have you been to Los Angeles?

472
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:09,375
Did you meet anyone famous?

473
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:15,125
Well, as a matter of fact, I did Um.

474
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,726
Eddie Cantor

475
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,685
Dorothy Lamour - Dorothy Lamour?

476
00:37:20,709 --> 00:37:24,351
We actually became quite friendly

477
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:28,768
I was on a theatrical exchange
Six months' sabbatical.

478
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:30,000
Mr Burton?

479
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,334
Yes, Jenkins?

480
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:37,101
There is something
I wanted to ask you.

481
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:40,584
Or-or you know, tell
you, really, I suppose.

482
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:44,417
- Oh, yes?
- I was thinking, see

483
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:46,667
that I might

484
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:49,792
want to be an actor.

485
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:56,060
You would like to be an actor?

486
00:37:56,084 --> 00:37:59,435
I know it's not usual,
but I wondered if, you know,

487
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:01,125
if you thought that I could.

488
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:09,226
I could do it, sir I know I could.

489
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,685
- If you was to help me.
- If I <i>were</i> to help you.

490
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,810
Yes Yes, yes, sir You know?

491
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,601
If If you were to help me

492
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:21,417
I don't mean to be unkind, Jenkins, but

493
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:24,351
it's been a long day.

494
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:30,435
"And a" I want for now
is to wonder at the stars

495
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:34,792
and for no one to drop
an incendiary on us

496
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:15,601
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, Mr Burton.

497
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:19,084
Thank you, sir - Thank you, sir.

498
00:39:21,334 --> 00:39:23,042
Jenkins, have you got a moment?

499
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,042
Are you free this afternoon?

500
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:33,875
I can be, sir.

501
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:42,209
Right then, Jenkins Follow me.

502
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,768
Where are we gonna go then, sir?

503
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:48,375
"Go" not "gor."

504
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,167
"Go" Go Go - Up there.

505
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,018
Don't throw stones

506
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:58,334
into lonely holes without
knowing where they're going.

507
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,685
Read that sign for me.

508
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:07,209
"Please close the gate."

509
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:11,084
"Gate" not "gairt."

510
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:13,893
Gate.

511
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:15,875
"Please close the gate."

512
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:18,375
"Please close the gate."

513
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,393
Listen to the vowel sounds.

514
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:26,101
An actor must know how
to extract their fu" value

515
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:29,792
"Please close the gate".

516
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:34,500
"Please close the gate."

517
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:38,000
Now.

518
00:40:39,334 --> 00:40:41,518
Please close the gate.

519
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:43,417
Huh? Oh.

520
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,667
Pitch Pronunciation Emphasis.

521
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:52,375
These are the skills
you must learn to employ.

522
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:57,310
Are we gonna talk by 'ere
then, sir, are we?

523
00:40:57,334 --> 00:40:59,500
Going Go-ing.

524
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,560
And, please, Jenkins, the word is "here",

525
00:41:03,584 --> 00:41:05,476
not "by 'ere".

526
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,792
"H'yere"
- Shorten the vowel "Here".

527
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:10,726
H'yere.

528
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,685
Aspirate.

529
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:16,726
Have you heard Heather Hodder
is here at the hotel

530
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,375
happily having hysterics? Here.

531
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,250
Here.

532
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:26,893
And, in answer to your question,
yes, we are

533
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,726
I don't think Mrs Smith
would appreciate our company

534
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,643
under the circumstances.

535
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:34,584
Now then <i>Henry V.</i>

536
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:38,435
Let us start with the Chorus speech,

537
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:42,101
with which, of course, you are familiar.

538
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:47,601
The Chorus is an incantation, as it were.

539
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:50,476
Your task is simply
to deliver the meaning

540
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,476
of what is, after all,

541
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:59,084
an unusual form of speech,
Elizabethan blank verse.

542
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:01,292
Let's hear it.

543
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,518
O for a Muse of fire,

544
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:07,935
that would ascend the brightest
heaven of invention.

545
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,042
Stop.

546
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:15,459
That is mostly dreadful.

547
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:20,476
Right Stand firm Plant your feet.

548
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,750
Shoulders back Head erect.

549
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:27,935
Good.

550
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:29,875
Let's give it another try.

551
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:33,584
Are you able to hear me?

552
00:42:34,542 --> 00:42:35,601
Yes.

553
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:37,851
O for a Muse of fire

554
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:41,685
that would ascend the brightest
heaven of invention.

555
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:43,459
Are you able to hear that?

556
00:42:44,917 --> 00:42:46,459
Yes.

557
00:42:47,709 --> 00:42:51,375
Good Now you have a try

558
00:42:53,334 --> 00:42:55,393
O for a Muse of fire
that would ascend.

559
00:42:55,417 --> 00:42:56,834
Stop.

560
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:58,875
Was I shouting?

561
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:01,268
No.

562
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:05,518
Volume, Jenkins,
is of secondary importance.

563
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:09,084
Distinctness, this is what you must learn.

564
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:15,643
Now, I would like you to scream,
as loud as you can.

565
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:17,060
Scream?

566
00:43:17,084 --> 00:43:18,125
Scream

567
00:43:28,584 --> 00:43:30,000
And again

568
00:43:37,667 --> 00:43:42,185
Screaming, as with shouting,

569
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:47,060
is simply moving as much air
out of your lungs as you can,

570
00:43:47,084 --> 00:43:50,893
and straining your vocal cords
to make a sound.

571
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:56,726
Projection, on the other hand,
filling a theatre,

572
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,209
that is a matter of using
the muscle in your diaphragm,

573
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,268
here, and your lungs, here,

574
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:09,601
so that you can control
the flow of air, retain clarity,

575
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:13,143
and make a significant
increase in volume.

576
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:17,060
Your task, therefore, is to distinguish

577
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:20,351
between these two things.

578
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:25,393
So, stay here until nightfall if necessary,

579
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:27,459
and I will see you in the morning.

580
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:30,459
First lesson, I believe.

581
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:35,143
Are you leaving me h'yere? Here.

582
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:37,560
Scream and scream

583
00:44:37,584 --> 00:44:40,726
until you can find a way for it not to hurt

584
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:44,667
I know it sounds primitive,
but it will be effective.

585
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,042
Scream

586
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:55,000
Louder

587
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:10,643
"Everything a" right up there, is it?

588
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,018
Yes, thank you.

589
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:20,185
Sss Shh Fff.

590
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:21,476
Mah

591
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,393
Jenkins Mrs Smith, my landlady.

592
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:25,476
How do you do?

593
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,768
Jenkins feels that
he would like to be an actor.

594
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,334
Oh, is that a fact?

595
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,893
Your voice is raspy, uncontrolled

596
00:45:43,917 --> 00:45:47,185
and completely lacking in range.

597
00:45:47,209 --> 00:45:50,709
"Indeed, we may we" be wasting our time.

598
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:52,893
<i>O for a Muse of fire</i>

599
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,685
<i>that would ascend the brightest
heaven of invention.</i>

600
00:45:55,709 --> 00:45:57,643
<i>My kingdom for a stage, princes to act,</i>

601
00:45:57,667 --> 00:45:59,810
<i>and monarchs to behold
the swelling scene</i>

602
00:45:59,834 --> 00:46:02,143
<i>Dear me, that voice.</i>

603
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:05,560
A voice you can work on
He has a good face.

604
00:46:05,584 --> 00:46:08,893
A good face, and eyes like a cat.

605
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:11,875
<i>If you want to be
a professional actor,</i>

606
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:15,125
it must be
not because of encouragement

607
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:18,060
but in spite of discouragement.

608
00:46:18,084 --> 00:46:21,101
You have promise.

609
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:25,435
But without discipline,
promise will remain unfulfilled"ed.

610
00:46:25,459 --> 00:46:31,018
An old actor once told me that
nobody can play Shakespeare

611
00:46:31,042 --> 00:46:36,310
until he can recite all
six verses of the First Psalm

612
00:46:36,334 --> 00:46:37,834
in a single breath.

613
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:40,643
"Blessed is the man that walketh
not in the counsel

614
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:42,226
of the ungodly, nor standeth
in the way of sinners,

615
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,601
nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful,

616
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:44,810
but his delight is in the law of the Lord,

617
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:46,185
and in His law
doth he meditate day and night,

618
00:46:46,209 --> 00:46:47,935
and he shall be like a tree
planted by the rivers of water,

619
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:49,268
that bringeth forth his fruit in his season;

620
00:46:49,292 --> 00:46:50,351
his leaf also shall not wither;

621
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:53,167
and whatsoever he doeth
shall prosper ""

622
00:46:55,542 --> 00:46:58,709
Did you know that already?

623
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:02,875
Not in English, I didn't

624
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,042
O for a Muse of fire that was.

625
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:30,893
"The rain comes pittering pattering down,

626
00:47:30,917 --> 00:47:33,185
plippetty, plippetty plop".

627
00:47:33,209 --> 00:47:34,768
"The farmer drives his horse to town,

628
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:37,101
"- clippetty, clippetty clop"
- Richard.

629
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:39,143
"The rain comes pattering,
horse goes clattering,

630
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:42,917
- "clippetty, clippetty clop"
- Richard! For God sakes, boy!

631
00:47:44,709 --> 00:47:48,000
Don't you see what this teacher is doing?

632
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:52,310
We", you wouldn't understand,
would you?

633
00:47:52,334 --> 00:47:54,250
You're an intellectual brute.

634
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,042
Richie.

635
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,292
You

636
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:06,292
talking like that, you

637
00:48:08,042 --> 00:48:10,875
you're not just talking to me, you know.

638
00:48:11,042 --> 00:48:12,810
"You're talking it at a" of us.

639
00:48:12,834 --> 00:48:17,334
Your sister, your father, your mother.

640
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:21,018
Everybody you come from

641
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:28,709
Look, I.

642
00:48:30,959 --> 00:48:35,042
I'm not so good at the Welsh, I know that.

643
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:38,375
But I know who I am.

644
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:44,542
Now, your voice,
that's your birthright, it is.

645
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:47,584
<i>Your</i> voice

646
00:48:51,709 --> 00:48:54,667
<i>Oh, I do feel so queer.</i>

647
00:48:56,084 --> 00:48:58,000
<i>Did you put something funny
in the champagne?</i>

648
00:48:58,584 --> 00:49:00,226
<i>Yes The bubbles</i>

649
00:49:01,334 --> 00:49:05,643
<i>It took me hours Every single
little bubble put in by hand,</i>

650
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:06,750
<i>rather gently.</i>

651
00:49:08,167 --> 00:49:10,935
<i>Don't you think I deserve
just a little reward for that?</i>

652
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:12,000
<i>Oh, no</i>

653
00:49:13,459 --> 00:49:16,101
<i>I'm not going to budge
from here until I get that kiss</i>

654
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:18,084
<i>and I'm sitting very comfortably</i>

655
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:22,560
<i>You won my bet? You?</i>

656
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:25,768
Presumptuous insect! I won it.

657
00:49:25,792 --> 00:49:27,685
What did you throw those
slippers at me for?

658
00:49:27,709 --> 00:49:29,726
Because I wanted to smash your face

659
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,000
I'd like to ki" you, you selfish brute.

660
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:36,000
The creature is nervous, after a".

661
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:40,893
Ah Would you? Claws in, you cat.

662
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:42,935
How dare you show your temper to me?

663
00:49:42,959 --> 00:49:44,435
What's to become of me?

664
00:49:55,042 --> 00:49:56,209
Head back.

665
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:04,584
That hurt?

666
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:07,459
No.

667
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:11,792
No, no, doesn't 'urt.

668
00:50:13,042 --> 00:50:16,000
"Hurt" Aspirate.

669
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:25,084
What on earth is the matter, Richard?

670
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:27,625
The show went we".

671
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:31,459
Yeah, we", now I go back
to Caradoc Street.

672
00:50:33,584 --> 00:50:36,417
There What is wrong with that?

673
00:50:39,209 --> 00:50:40,851
I'm not much wanted there.

674
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:43,351
Oh, I hardly believe that.

675
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:46,268
Your sister dotes on you.

676
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:47,601
It's Elfed that's the problem.

677
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:49,810
He hates me He's crushing me.

678
00:50:49,834 --> 00:50:51,810
Honestly, Mr Burton,
I can't stand it anymore

679
00:50:51,834 --> 00:50:53,518
I don't know what I'm going to do.

680
00:50:53,542 --> 00:50:55,560
There's no space in my father's house.

681
00:50:55,584 --> 00:50:56,917
There we are.

682
00:50:58,625 --> 00:51:01,435
That should be serviceable
for tomorrow night.

683
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:04,060
I'd rent a room,
if I could find one.

684
00:51:04,084 --> 00:51:06,750
We", of course,
Mrs Smith has a vacant room.

685
00:51:09,292 --> 00:51:12,601
- I can move in with you!
- Hmm?

686
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:15,851
I'm quite sure Elfed
and especially your sister

687
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:18,875
- wouldn't want you to.
- Could you ask her, Mr Burton?

688
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:20,893
For me? Could you? Just ask her.

689
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:24,584
Dear me, no I
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

690
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:32,000
You see?

691
00:51:33,834 --> 00:51:35,584
When push comes to shove

692
00:51:37,084 --> 00:51:38,709
nobody wants me.

693
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:43,584
I'm sorry, Richard.

694
00:51:45,417 --> 00:51:49,018
<i>I cannot pretend that
I don't have my misgivings</i>

695
00:51:49,042 --> 00:51:51,560
I've never had a lodger of such an age,

696
00:51:51,584 --> 00:51:54,167
and how can he afford
five shillings a week?

697
00:51:56,584 --> 00:52:00,167
But, I-I-I do have other concerns.

698
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:05,875
As you know, teaching a young
man here, that is one thing.

699
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:08,875
But having him living in the house?

700
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:12,375
It's bound to fuel

701
00:52:14,459 --> 00:52:16,000
speculation.

702
00:52:19,209 --> 00:52:24,000
We", you do not need to worry
about <i>me,</i> Ma.

703
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:29,042
"Yes, but I <i>do</i> worry,
a" the same, Mr Burton.

704
00:52:30,292 --> 00:52:34,435
Besides, this may be quite academic.

705
00:52:34,459 --> 00:52:37,459
His sister and brother-in-law
may well not agree.

706
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:16,125
Thank you, Mr James.

707
00:53:18,834 --> 00:53:20,000
Please.

708
00:53:21,292 --> 00:53:24,000
- Good afternoon, Mrs James.
- He"o, Mr Burton.

709
00:53:27,292 --> 00:53:30,167
- Shall I take that for you?
- Coat.

710
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:34,185
<i>As you know,
Richard has asked me</i>

711
00:53:34,209 --> 00:53:38,476
if he might move
the few streets from here

712
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:43,143
to Mrs Smith's house,
where I currently reside.

713
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:44,792
But

714
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:48,893
I should say at once, however,

715
00:53:48,917 --> 00:53:51,060
I think there are a number of reasons

716
00:53:51,084 --> 00:53:54,084
why this might <i>not</i> be a good idea.

717
00:53:57,584 --> 00:54:00,625
But it was your idea, the boy did tell me.

718
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,417
It is true, that, uh

719
00:54:05,584 --> 00:54:10,459
unthinkingly, I
I did mention a vacant room.

720
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:13,500
So you won't take him on?

721
00:54:15,209 --> 00:54:19,875
I do not wish to imply any lack
of commitment to Richard.

722
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:23,601
As you know, I have
dedicated a lot of time to him.

723
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:26,351
Enlisting him in the RAF Cadet Force,

724
00:54:26,375 --> 00:54:28,726
and helping him with his schoolwork

725
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,185
and craft of acting.

726
00:54:31,209 --> 00:54:34,476
And, indeed, he has been made
remarkable progress

727
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,935
in all these areas.

728
00:54:36,959 --> 00:54:39,292
We might even consider university.

729
00:54:40,625 --> 00:54:42,125
University?

730
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:48,250
But to move out of the family home is.

731
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:51,667
Well, it's a considerable step.

732
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,351
Is he old enough?

733
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:57,935
Is he responsible enough?

734
00:54:57,959 --> 00:54:59,334
So you would pay his rent?

735
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:07,226
After long consideration,
I would be prepared to meet.

736
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:10,500
Then I think you should
take him on, Mr Burton.

737
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:13,709
Please.

738
00:55:14,792 --> 00:55:16,000
Take him on.

739
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,042
Where is Richard?

740
00:55:24,959 --> 00:55:26,875
Upstairs, he is.

741
00:55:27,042 --> 00:55:32,500
Perhaps we should discuss this
together in the same room.

742
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,084
"Well, I'" go fetch him, then.

743
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:50,042
Mrs James

744
00:55:51,292 --> 00:55:56,000
Richard is your son much more
than he is your brother.

745
00:55:57,209 --> 00:55:59,584
I know how much you love each other.

746
00:56:00,584 --> 00:56:05,542
Please, tell me, what is it
you want me to do?

747
00:56:07,709 --> 00:56:09,667
If you take him, Mr Burton,

748
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:13,334
"it'" be the answer to my prayers

749
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,851
Hello?

750
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:04,768
Eight o'clock, Richard
Ma likes us to be prompt.

751
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:06,417
A" right.

752
00:57:24,334 --> 00:57:26,310
Perhaps you could tidy your bedroom

753
00:57:26,334 --> 00:57:27,935
after breakfast, Richard.

754
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:31,560
P'rhaps - Per-haps.

755
00:57:31,584 --> 00:57:33,351
Per-haps.

756
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:34,834
- Enough?
- Hmm.

757
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:53,125
Good morning - Morning, Ma.

758
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:56,209
- How did you sleep?
- Like an innocent.

759
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,935
Right No, no, I'm sorry, Richie,

760
00:57:59,959 --> 00:58:03,060
but that that really will not do here.

761
00:58:03,084 --> 00:58:04,750
Right No.

762
00:58:06,042 --> 00:58:09,625
Use the edge towards you Right?

763
00:58:10,459 --> 00:58:13,351
No, no, no, no No, no, no

764
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:16,476
Bring it Bring it to your mouth.

765
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,167
Right? Dear me.

766
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:21,685
Well!

767
00:58:21,709 --> 00:58:23,268
Right - That's better.

768
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:26,042
"And whatever you do, don't
speak with your mouth fu"

769
00:58:27,709 --> 00:58:29,435
Oh, for goodness' sake

770
00:58:29,459 --> 00:58:30,917
I thought I could smell something!

771
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:35,685
Well, I only have
the two pairs, Ma.

772
00:58:35,709 --> 00:58:37,893
Right Well, honestly,
there's more hole than sock

773
00:58:39,209 --> 00:58:40,667
Did your mother never think.

774
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:49,542
"It's a" right, Ma.

775
00:58:52,167 --> 00:58:55,917
I was only two I don't remember
anything about her.

776
00:59:02,084 --> 00:59:05,459
We", it's a good job I'm here
Myself and Mr Burton.

777
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:09,185
Right We", finish your breakfast,

778
00:59:09,209 --> 00:59:10,685
and then take them off,

779
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:12,500
"and I'" if I can't find some fresh ones.

780
00:59:17,209 --> 00:59:19,435
- What's that?
- Hmm?

781
00:59:19,459 --> 00:59:21,917
Oh Nothing

782
00:59:36,084 --> 00:59:38,750
Yes?

783
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:44,084
Do you never
get lonely, living on your own?

784
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:48,209
A cultured person is never lonely.

785
00:59:54,334 --> 00:59:57,167
<i>"The lips of time
leech to the fountain head".</i>

786
00:59:58,292 --> 01:00:00,393
<i>"Love drips and gathers,</i>

787
01:00:00,417 --> 01:00:02,917
but the fallen blood shall calm her sores".

788
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:07,518
"And I am dumb to tell a weather's wind

789
01:00:07,542 --> 01:00:10,542
how time has ticked
a heaven round the stars".

790
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:15,084
That's wonderful - Isn't it, though?

791
01:00:16,459 --> 01:00:17,792
God knows what it means.

792
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:21,875
Where'd you find it?

793
01:00:23,042 --> 01:00:25,893
Well, I've got PH's library, don't I?

794
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:28,000
I even have his socks

795
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,875
You know, Richie.

796
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:36,682
You're not a bit like I thought you'd be.

797
01:00:39,709 --> 01:00:40,750
How so?

798
01:00:43,542 --> 01:00:46,542
"I thought you'd be more, we"

799
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,726
all hands

800
01:00:50,584 --> 01:00:54,000
You know what I mean.

801
01:00:56,584 --> 01:01:00,417
And you never not with me.

802
01:01:02,042 --> 01:01:04,709
Yeah, we", that's because
I'm a gentleman.

803
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:16,875
You do want to though, don't you?

804
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,792
Of course I bloody want to.

805
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,167
Good.

806
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:33,542
Why on earth would you think I don't?

807
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:38,625
I dunno It's nothing

808
01:01:49,417 --> 01:01:50,667
Richard?

809
01:01:59,042 --> 01:02:03,393
I would like you to repeat
your mathematics paper.

810
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:04,834
My mathematics?

811
01:02:06,334 --> 01:02:07,851
But, PH, you said it was good.

812
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:09,709
Good, yes, but, uh

813
01:02:11,042 --> 01:02:13,250
good is not good enough

814
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:20,101
But I want to be
an actor, not a professor

815
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:21,601
Richard.

816
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:27,101
To be an actor, you will need to
move in certain social spheres,

817
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:32,518
and, as it happens, the RAF
have a new six-month scholarship

818
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:36,000
for several cadets
to study at Oxford University.

819
01:02:37,334 --> 01:02:41,000
And my friend, Sir Cyril Cooke,
is in charge

820
01:02:42,167 --> 01:02:43,351
Oxford?

821
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:45,851
Oxford, yes.

822
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:49,500
But, uh your marks
will need to be excellent So.

823
01:02:50,459 --> 01:02:52,351
You have an hour from now

824
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:55,018
and if you do not better your mark,

825
01:02:55,042 --> 01:02:56,500
I will set you another.

826
01:02:59,417 --> 01:03:00,625
Yes, PH.

827
01:03:02,167 --> 01:03:03,417
Oh, and Richard?

828
01:03:04,334 --> 01:03:07,893
If you continue to be late
for our appointments,

829
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:10,768
I may be forced
to reconsider our arrangement.

830
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:13,375
Do I make myself clear?

831
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,625
Sorry.

832
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:08,417
I, um.

833
01:04:10,209 --> 01:04:11,584
Uh.

834
01:04:13,792 --> 01:04:16,209
I didn't know you was writing
for the theatre, PH.

835
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,625
Yes.

836
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:25,084
Although, as you can see

837
01:04:26,834 --> 01:04:30,792
not to the satisfaction
of HM Tennent Limited.

838
01:04:32,792 --> 01:04:35,125
Well, your work's good enough
for the BBC.

839
01:04:36,792 --> 01:04:39,792
A regional service of the BBC.

840
01:04:41,834 --> 01:04:44,584
I did have a job in London We...

841
01:04:45,917 --> 01:04:47,750
The offer of a job, at least.

842
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:50,917
But then the war broke out.

843
01:04:55,042 --> 01:04:58,417
You mean, you don't want
to be a teacher?

844
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:03,542
No Don't misunderstand me.

845
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:08,310
I believe teaching is a noble profession

846
01:05:08,334 --> 01:05:09,726
I suppose I didn't think

847
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:12,334
I'd spend so much of my life doing it.

848
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:17,310
But the Ministry of Labour

849
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:20,685
considers my talents, such as they are,

850
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:25,209
better suited to the classroom
than Broadcasting House.

851
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:27,375
And thus.

852
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:32,292
I fell out of step with the London stage.

853
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:38,268
So, have you written other plays, then?

854
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:40,209
Too many, perhaps.

855
01:05:48,917 --> 01:05:51,042
So, writing must also be pursued

856
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:55,000
in spite of discouragement.

857
01:05:58,042 --> 01:05:59,250
I suppose it must.

858
01:06:06,334 --> 01:06:09,875
PH, no one understands the stage
like you.

859
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:12,935
I know that for certain

860
01:06:12,959 --> 01:06:16,667
I mean, your work as a director.

861
01:06:19,167 --> 01:06:22,268
I watch it in wonder I do.

862
01:06:22,292 --> 01:06:24,084
And if you hadn't been h'yere

863
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:30,667
Been here.

864
01:06:33,834 --> 01:06:36,084
We", I dunno.

865
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:39,459
We never would have met.

866
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:44,875
I must show you something.

867
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:06,018
Now, they are only minor roles,

868
01:07:06,042 --> 01:07:07,893
and there will be fierce competition.

869
01:07:07,917 --> 01:07:09,667
"Emlyn wants Welsh actors."

870
01:07:11,209 --> 01:07:12,935
"Mr Emlyn Williams is looking for

871
01:07:12,959 --> 01:07:14,560
several Welsh actors and actresses

872
01:07:14,584 --> 01:07:16,351
for small parts in his new play".

873
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:20,185
"Types wanted vary from young
people to character actors"

874
01:07:20,209 --> 01:07:22,685
I could inform him of our interest.

875
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:23,935
Of <i>your</i> interest.

876
01:07:23,959 --> 01:07:25,185
Emlyn Williams

877
01:07:25,209 --> 01:07:29,042
I do know Williams a bit.

878
01:07:35,959 --> 01:07:37,459
Thank you.

879
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:43,625
You should get some sleep.

880
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,709
O for a Muse of fire

881
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:16,810
that would ascend

882
01:08:16,834 --> 01:08:19,709
the brightest heaven of invention.

883
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:25,143
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act

884
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:28,500
and monarchs to behold
the swelling scene.

885
01:08:30,334 --> 01:08:36,750
Then, should the warlike Harry,
like himself,

886
01:08:38,292 --> 01:08:41,268
assume the port of Mars,

887
01:08:41,292 --> 01:08:44,810
and at his heels, leashed in like hounds,

888
01:08:44,834 --> 01:08:49,334
should famine, sword and fire
crouch for employment

889
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:59,292
He really is a changed boy
these days, Cyril.

890
01:09:00,959 --> 01:09:04,601
In the ATC, on the fire-watch rota,

891
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:09,000
and his marks have improved
beyond all recognition.

892
01:09:10,542 --> 01:09:14,101
Well, you know I respect
your judgement, PH

893
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:15,435
I will support you, of course.

894
01:09:15,459 --> 01:09:20,084
Although, to be candid,
I do foresee certain problems.

895
01:09:23,084 --> 01:09:26,542
His background, for instance
He's a miner's son, isn't he?

896
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:30,893
Not that I have anything against
miners' sons, of course,

897
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:35,375
but, um, they are hardly the
type that Oxbridge smiles on.

898
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:37,875
And then

899
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:41,375
there is the matter of the surname.

900
01:09:42,334 --> 01:09:43,542
How How do you mean?

901
01:09:44,542 --> 01:09:47,334
The boy's name is Jenkins
Yours is Burton.

902
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:50,810
He lives with you

903
01:09:50,834 --> 01:09:53,542
and it will inevitably lead to questions.

904
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:57,750
And with competition for
the RAF scholarship so fierce.

905
01:10:01,209 --> 01:10:04,518
Anyhow, best get on
This war isn't winning itself.

906
01:10:04,542 --> 01:10:07,917
Yes Yes, of course Thank you, Sir Cyril.

907
01:10:10,917 --> 01:10:14,851
Look, PH, I know a man's name
shouldn't hold him back

908
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:18,792
in this day and age, but
you know how these things work

909
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:30,935
The drops are dripping

910
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:35,560
That's Dic Jenkins's boy, that is

911
01:10:35,584 --> 01:10:36,875
It's not, is it?

912
01:10:37,042 --> 01:10:38,393
Living with that teacher

913
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:40,518
- Guess what he's after.
- Yeah

914
01:10:53,042 --> 01:10:54,750
More tea, PH?

915
01:10:58,084 --> 01:11:01,375
Oh Yes Thank you, Richard.

916
01:11:09,417 --> 01:11:10,625
Richard.

917
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:17,851
We need to discuss your
application for a scholarship

918
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:19,334
to Oxford University.

919
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:21,750
Right.

920
01:11:23,584 --> 01:11:26,834
As you know,
this is an enormous opportunity.

921
01:11:27,792 --> 01:11:29,018
And, thankfully,

922
01:11:29,042 --> 01:11:33,334
Sir Cyril has agreed
to support the application.

923
01:11:35,042 --> 01:11:36,375
Lovely.

924
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:40,226
But there is a a caveat.

925
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:45,018
He believes that my putting you forward

926
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:48,851
as a concerned teacher

927
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:53,834
will raise awkward questions
about your living arrangements.

928
01:11:57,459 --> 01:11:58,459
I see.

929
01:12:00,834 --> 01:12:03,042
For me to put you forward,

930
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:07,268
and for that to be accepted
without question,

931
01:12:07,292 --> 01:12:09,268
would require me to

932
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:12,875
to take legal responsibility for you.

933
01:12:14,834 --> 01:12:16,459
What do you mean, legal?

934
01:12:22,667 --> 01:12:23,726
Adopt me?

935
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:29,042
Think of this as a means
to an end, a formality, but

936
01:12:30,459 --> 01:12:33,643
inevitably, this would require you to.

937
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:35,125
Change my name?

938
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:53,917
Fine.

939
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:56,875
Change it.

940
01:13:01,834 --> 01:13:02,875
Right.

941
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:07,542
Um, in order to do that,

942
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:12,750
we would need the permission
of your current legal guardian.

943
01:13:14,167 --> 01:13:17,125
Who's that? Is it Cis?

944
01:13:19,084 --> 01:13:21,417
No I'm afraid not

945
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:47,875
Who the bloody hell is this?

946
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,875
It would a"ow me to go to university.

947
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,042
Perhaps even to Oxford.

948
01:14:31,542 --> 01:14:32,792
I need you to sign it.

949
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:40,643
"The infant, Richard Walter Jenkins,

950
01:14:40,667 --> 01:14:42,476
shall, from the date hereof,

951
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:47,917
absolutely renounce and abandon
the surname of the parent,

952
01:14:49,667 --> 01:14:51,667
Richard Walter Jenkins

953
01:14:57,792 --> 01:15:02,268
and shall bear the surname
of the adopter,

954
01:15:02,292 --> 01:15:05,542
Philip Henry Burton

955
01:15:09,875 --> 01:15:12,143
and shall be held out to the world

956
01:15:12,167 --> 01:15:13,935
and in all respects treated

957
01:15:13,959 --> 01:15:18,167
"as if he were, in fact,
the child of the adopter"

958
01:15:41,459 --> 01:15:42,792
We", boy

959
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,209
you need to know.

960
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:51,875
This won't come for nothing

961
01:16:23,875 --> 01:16:25,209
Fifty pounds?

962
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:30,000
And how would you like the notes?

963
01:16:31,042 --> 01:16:33,417
Uh, five-pound notes will be fine

964
01:17:02,292 --> 01:17:03,935
He's from Scotland, isn't he?

965
01:17:03,959 --> 01:17:05,685
Stay here.

966
01:17:05,709 --> 01:17:07,250
PH - It's for the best

967
01:17:56,709 --> 01:17:57,750
Hey.

968
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:00,810
Do you want any more?

969
01:18:00,834 --> 01:18:03,834
I've got another ten

970
01:18:07,792 --> 01:18:09,000
We", lad.

971
01:18:10,375 --> 01:18:12,750
Looks like the boys are right.

972
01:18:13,417 --> 01:18:15,709
They said you'd turned into a poofter.

973
01:18:18,834 --> 01:18:19,875
Hmm

974
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:32,000
We'll pop this in the post
on the way home.

975
01:18:35,584 --> 01:18:39,250
I, uh I think I need to take a walk.

976
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:41,792
Of course.

977
01:18:43,459 --> 01:18:45,000
I-I'll meet you for dinner.

978
01:18:46,584 --> 01:18:48,167
Maybe we'll open a bottle

979
01:19:54,042 --> 01:19:55,292
Richie?

980
01:19:56,584 --> 01:19:59,268
Ah, there you are

981
01:20:08,792 --> 01:20:10,893
Thought you'd get me drunk, did you?

982
01:20:10,917 --> 01:20:13,250
Of course not.

983
01:20:16,042 --> 01:20:20,042
I thought, uh, well,
we have things to celebrate.

984
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:24,000
Do we not? Or mark, at any rate.

985
01:20:25,209 --> 01:20:27,393
Your exam results, and.

986
01:20:27,417 --> 01:20:29,476
We ", a" we have achieved together

987
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:35,917
Richie You'll wake up Ma.

988
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:39,459
"- I'" shut this door

989
01:20:41,709 --> 01:20:43,000
Mr Burton?

990
01:20:46,834 --> 01:20:48,875
Do you really think I'm that stupid?

991
01:20:52,167 --> 01:20:54,768
Do you think I don't know
what you're up to?

992
01:20:54,792 --> 01:20:57,726
What What are you talking about?

993
01:20:59,959 --> 01:21:02,459
You know very we"
what I'm talking about.

994
01:21:05,459 --> 01:21:07,834
Richard - Good old PH, eh?

995
01:21:10,709 --> 01:21:11,917
How he, um

996
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:15,834
clothed me.

997
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:20,542
He fed me.

998
01:21:22,417 --> 01:21:24,768
A" out of the goodness of his heart

999
01:21:24,792 --> 01:21:27,476
Richard, let me make you a cup of tea.

1000
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:30,875
It's the worst-kept secret
in fucking Port Talbot.

1001
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:32,209
Richard.

1002
01:21:33,292 --> 01:21:36,101
It's been an eventful day A long day.

1003
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:39,185
And you I'm sure you need some sleep.

1004
01:21:39,209 --> 01:21:42,643
Do you think I don't know
what it is that you want?

1005
01:21:42,667 --> 01:21:44,268
Richard

1006
01:21:44,292 --> 01:21:48,685
I have done everything for you,
everything that you requested,

1007
01:21:48,709 --> 01:21:50,810
and I have asked for nothing in return.

1008
01:21:50,834 --> 01:21:55,560
Nothing, except to
to see you flourish as an actor.

1009
01:21:55,584 --> 01:21:59,584
Yes, perhaps a little gratitude,
but good God.

1010
01:22:00,959 --> 01:22:02,685
In a matter of weeks,

1011
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:04,810
you will be auditioning for Daphne Rye

1012
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:06,334
Daphne Rye.

1013
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:11,310
Perhaps the most influential
casting director in the country.

1014
01:22:11,334 --> 01:22:14,667
And she will be paying you
particular attention.

1015
01:22:17,292 --> 01:22:19,893
Do you suppose these things
happen by chance?

1016
01:22:19,917 --> 01:22:25,060
Or-or-or are you in some way
special? Is that it?

1017
01:22:25,084 --> 01:22:26,250
Richard?

1018
01:22:31,084 --> 01:22:32,084
Well, is it?

1019
01:23:30,417 --> 01:23:33,476
Richie What on earth are you doing?

1020
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:37,042
Come down, will you?
I need to talk to you

1021
01:24:56,792 --> 01:24:59,518
I am sorry if we disturbed
you last night, Ma

1022
01:24:59,542 --> 01:25:03,042
Well, no you didn't disturb me.

1023
01:25:07,084 --> 01:25:09,125
Let me make you some tea.

1024
01:25:10,417 --> 01:25:12,917
I am afraid we may have
to find you a new tenant.

1025
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:27,667
Mr Burton.

1026
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:33,560
I don't want to say that
I was afraid this would happen,

1027
01:25:33,584 --> 01:25:35,792
because - I know.

1028
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:42,393
I don't want to speak ill of Richie,

1029
01:25:42,417 --> 01:25:44,351
however terribly he's behaved

1030
01:25:44,375 --> 01:25:47,000
because I've become so fond of the boy.

1031
01:25:50,334 --> 01:25:53,101
Do you remember
that first play at the YMCA?

1032
01:25:53,125 --> 01:25:54,792
We...

1033
01:25:55,709 --> 01:25:59,292
That's how he's been to me,
right from the start.

1034
01:26:00,417 --> 01:26:05,000
Scared and hunted, I suppose you'd say.

1035
01:26:08,709 --> 01:26:11,351
We could have given him
all the kindness in the world,

1036
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:15,292
and nothing was ever
going to change that, ever.

1037
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:22,518
"But to throw it a" back at me?

1038
01:26:22,542 --> 01:26:24,226
I know.

1039
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:27,250
But who else, Mr Burton?

1040
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:29,625
You must know that.

1041
01:26:31,917 --> 01:26:35,750
Who else does he care about so much?

1042
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:59,476
I'm afraid it is a boy
we are looking for

1043
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:01,810
But she could pass
for a boy, Miss Rye, isn't it?

1044
01:27:01,834 --> 01:27:03,435
There is a war on, after all.

1045
01:27:03,459 --> 01:27:06,476
Yes, Mrs Barron, but it is a boy
we are looking for.

1046
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,584
Please, take a seat to the left.

1047
01:27:11,417 --> 01:27:12,792
Donald Brown.

1048
01:27:15,292 --> 01:27:16,625
Donald Brown?

1049
01:27:18,042 --> 01:27:19,584
No? Very we.

1050
01:27:21,875 --> 01:27:23,167
Richard Burton

1051
01:27:24,084 --> 01:27:26,042
Stand up straight

1052
01:27:32,084 --> 01:27:35,167
Don't forget to smile.

1053
01:27:38,167 --> 01:27:40,792
Ah, yes You're Philip Burton's boy.

1054
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:44,500
Yes, Miss Rye.

1055
01:27:46,334 --> 01:27:47,500
I, um.

1056
01:27:51,084 --> 01:27:53,750
I've, uh, I've memorised
the lines you sent.

1057
01:27:57,292 --> 01:27:58,292
Carry on, then.

1058
01:28:06,792 --> 01:28:08,560
What do I want with stories

1059
01:28:08,584 --> 01:28:10,250
when I got the hay to get in?

1060
01:28:13,209 --> 01:28:15,875
I 'aven't read a story,
not since I was in bed

1061
01:28:16,042 --> 01:28:17,625
from the stallion throwin' me.

1062
01:28:18,834 --> 01:28:20,792
I got to think about other things.

1063
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:23,042
Like girls.

1064
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:26,893
And what is the sky like for tomorrow

1065
01:28:26,917 --> 01:28:28,625
and the taste of a pint.

1066
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:34,393
And girls.

1067
01:28:34,417 --> 01:28:36,542
Thank you May I see your profile?

1068
01:28:45,209 --> 01:28:46,969
You can see the other
side too, if you like.

1069
01:28:49,834 --> 01:28:52,084
Is it particularly different?

1070
01:28:53,292 --> 01:28:54,709
You tell me.

1071
01:28:58,709 --> 01:29:00,917
Dear me, you are a bold one, aren't you?

1072
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,750
You cannot imagine.

1073
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:10,476
And your availability? You're in the RAF?

1074
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,685
I see Philip mentions a scholarship.

1075
01:29:12,709 --> 01:29:16,167
Yes In April, the RAF
are sending me to Oxford.

1076
01:29:17,375 --> 01:29:18,542
Exeter College.

1077
01:29:19,667 --> 01:29:22,334
Till then, my time is yours.

1078
01:29:26,209 --> 01:29:28,334
Stay and take a seat, if you would.

1079
01:29:38,667 --> 01:29:39,875
David Cecil.

1080
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:53,226
- David Lovely to see you again.
- Nice to see you too.

1081
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:55,685
Did you receive the play?

1082
01:30:10,834 --> 01:30:15,018
Marry, then sweet wag,
when thou art king,

1083
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:18,351
let not us that are squires
of the night's body

1084
01:30:18,375 --> 01:30:20,584
be called thieves of the day's beauty.

1085
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:23,209
Thou sayest well,

1086
01:30:24,917 --> 01:30:27,101
for the fortune of us
that are the moon's men

1087
01:30:27,125 --> 01:30:28,685
doth ebb and flow like the sea

1088
01:30:28,709 --> 01:30:30,768
being governed, as the sea is,
by the moon.

1089
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:35,084
No, Richard These are comic scenes.

1090
01:30:36,042 --> 01:30:38,601
Can't you make it a little lighter?

1091
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:42,768
Hal is a truant,
a boy who seeks enjoyment

1092
01:30:42,792 --> 01:30:44,875
rather than respectability.

1093
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:49,375
As you keep telling me.

1094
01:30:53,375 --> 01:30:59,834
So, what exactly are you failing to grasp?

1095
01:31:01,792 --> 01:31:04,000
You yourself seek enjoyment,
do you not?

1096
01:31:05,125 --> 01:31:06,875
Day and bloody night, as far as I can tell.

1097
01:31:07,042 --> 01:31:09,500
Everywhere, in fact,
except here, where it matters.

1098
01:31:11,334 --> 01:31:13,000
It's five o'clock - Thank you

1099
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,709
Rich.

1100
01:31:39,375 --> 01:31:41,042
That is your last.

1101
01:31:43,042 --> 01:31:46,351
Do you understand? You need
to pull yourself together

1102
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:48,893
I am perfectly intact

1103
01:31:48,917 --> 01:31:51,185
You are arseholed.

1104
01:31:51,209 --> 01:31:53,143
Again, Richard,
any other actor would give.

1105
01:31:53,167 --> 01:31:54,334
Actors!

1106
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:56,084
Actors!

1107
01:31:57,584 --> 01:31:59,750
I fucking hate actors.

1108
01:32:01,042 --> 01:32:03,459
Them and their their make-up.

1109
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:09,500
You know, what kind of man
wears make-up? I ask you that.

1110
01:32:14,709 --> 01:32:18,875
Give me leave to tell you
once again that at my birth

1111
01:32:19,042 --> 01:32:22,917
the front of heaven
was full of fiery shapes.

1112
01:32:24,167 --> 01:32:25,292
Here he is.

1113
01:32:26,542 --> 01:32:28,500
The English Glendower.

1114
01:32:30,542 --> 01:32:34,185
And behold, the Welsh Prince Hall

1115
01:32:34,209 --> 01:32:37,060
The indignity of it

1116
01:32:37,084 --> 01:32:38,560
Mel

1117
01:32:38,584 --> 01:32:41,584
Understudy to the drunken son
of a drunken bloody miner.

1118
01:32:43,875 --> 01:32:45,000
What?

1119
01:32:47,917 --> 01:32:49,643
It was just a joke, Rich.

1120
01:32:49,667 --> 01:32:51,125
Although, let's face it.

1121
01:32:58,792 --> 01:33:00,000
Let's face what?

1122
01:33:12,042 --> 01:33:13,167
Rich!

1123
01:33:14,417 --> 01:33:17,101
Jesus Christ You broke my nose!

1124
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:19,935
- It's just a scratch.
- Richard, come with me.

1125
01:33:19,959 --> 01:33:22,042
At last I thought
you would never capitulate.

1126
01:33:22,709 --> 01:33:25,167
Make sure it doesn't go on my shirt or tie.

1127
01:33:31,459 --> 01:33:33,685
Just what the hell is wrong with you?

1128
01:33:33,709 --> 01:33:36,268
Four bloody days until opening night

1129
01:33:36,292 --> 01:33:39,060
I told Tony you were
the only actor for the part.

1130
01:33:39,084 --> 01:33:41,750
And I promised him I would sort you out.

1131
01:33:46,292 --> 01:33:47,500
You?

1132
01:33:49,084 --> 01:33:50,667
Sort me out?

1133
01:33:57,917 --> 01:33:59,459
Nobody can sort me out.

1134
01:34:02,667 --> 01:34:06,209
Richard, I do in fact have a limit

1135
01:34:42,709 --> 01:34:44,709
399, Mrs Smith speaking.

1136
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,209
Oh, Rich Richie

1137
01:34:49,042 --> 01:34:51,042
Richie, Richie, what's the matter?

1138
01:34:52,542 --> 01:34:55,810
Uh No, Richie, no
Richie, no, it's terribly late.

1139
01:34:55,834 --> 01:34:58,167
It's gone one o'clock I couldn't possibly.

1140
01:34:59,167 --> 01:35:01,375
No, Richie Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1141
01:35:08,334 --> 01:35:09,542
Ma.

1142
01:35:11,459 --> 01:35:13,393
"I'm not at a" sure this is a good idea

1143
01:35:13,417 --> 01:35:14,768
I think I should telephone him.

1144
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:17,643
Mr Burton, there's not a cat's
chance that he's awake yet.

1145
01:35:17,667 --> 01:35:19,560
He was very much the worse for wear.

1146
01:35:19,584 --> 01:35:23,310
But he made it clear
that he needs you, urgently.

1147
01:35:23,334 --> 01:35:25,768
- But just to leave like.
- I shall call by the school

1148
01:35:25,792 --> 01:35:27,500
and explain the situation.

1149
01:35:30,084 --> 01:35:34,351
Now, Mr Burton,
Richie is your responsibility.

1150
01:35:34,375 --> 01:35:36,435
Now, I know that you didn't
part on the best terms,

1151
01:35:36,459 --> 01:35:40,209
but the fact remains, this is your duty.

1152
01:35:41,042 --> 01:35:43,042
If he needs you, then you must go

1153
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:48,601
Mr Burton.

1154
01:36:48,625 --> 01:36:50,125
Richard.

1155
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:54,459
Ah

1156
01:36:55,417 --> 01:36:58,042
You don't recall, uh.

1157
01:36:59,542 --> 01:37:03,834
You spoke to Mrs Smith
on the telephone last night.

1158
01:37:10,667 --> 01:37:11,834
Dear God.

1159
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:15,792
I must have been drunk

1160
01:37:22,167 --> 01:37:23,417
Is Ma we", then?

1161
01:37:25,334 --> 01:37:27,459
She is in excellent health.

1162
01:37:30,042 --> 01:37:31,125
Good.

1163
01:37:34,834 --> 01:37:37,560
A" right, everyone, we are moving on.

1164
01:37:37,584 --> 01:37:40,768
We're going back to
<i>Part I,</i> Act Three, Scene Two

1165
01:37:40,792 --> 01:37:44,185
Harry, if I could have you here,
upstage left, and Richard here.

1166
01:37:44,209 --> 01:37:46,875
Oh, and the throne will be
down here, downstage right,

1167
01:37:47,042 --> 01:37:49,518
with a marvellous white light from above.

1168
01:37:49,542 --> 01:37:52,268
All right Here we are
The lords have just scattered.

1169
01:37:52,292 --> 01:37:54,834
The King, the Prince Thank you, Harry.

1170
01:37:56,834 --> 01:37:59,310
I know not whether God will have it so

1171
01:37:59,334 --> 01:38:02,101
for some displeasing service
I have done,

1172
01:38:02,125 --> 01:38:04,875
but thou dost in thy passages of life

1173
01:38:05,042 --> 01:38:07,268
make me believe
that thou art only marked

1174
01:38:07,292 --> 01:38:09,226
for the hot vengeance

1175
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:12,893
and the rod of heaven
to punish my mistreadings.

1176
01:38:12,917 --> 01:38:15,393
So please Your Majesty, I would I could

1177
01:38:15,417 --> 01:38:17,625
"quit a" offences, I.

1178
01:38:22,084 --> 01:38:23,226
Um.

1179
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:24,393
Could a"?

1180
01:38:24,417 --> 01:38:27,667
With as clear - No I have it.

1181
01:38:31,167 --> 01:38:32,834
I I shall.

1182
01:38:33,334 --> 01:38:34,476
I shall.

1183
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:35,851
I, uh

1184
01:38:35,875 --> 01:38:40,167
I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,

1185
01:38:41,584 --> 01:38:43,060
be more myself.

1186
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:46,060
You skipped an entire page
there, Richard.

1187
01:38:46,084 --> 01:38:48,601
We're a matter of days away,
and you're still not off-book.

1188
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:49,851
Yes, I am aware of that.

1189
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:53,709
We will do that again
Uh, Daphne?

1190
01:38:56,875 --> 01:38:59,476
Who is this person
in my rehearsal room?

1191
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:01,292
"He's with me, Tony I'" explain later.

1192
01:39:02,292 --> 01:39:04,226
A" right, let's get on with it.

1193
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:06,060
Let's pick it up again from the top

1194
01:39:06,084 --> 01:39:08,042
Harry, please, in your own time

1195
01:39:15,042 --> 01:39:16,084
Richard.

1196
01:39:19,417 --> 01:39:22,125
It's been four years
since I was last in Stratford.

1197
01:39:22,625 --> 01:39:25,917
I shall go to the Holy Trinity,
pay my respects.

1198
01:39:27,292 --> 01:39:28,792
You've visited the grave?

1199
01:39:31,417 --> 01:39:32,625
No Not yet.

1200
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:36,584
So.

1201
01:39:37,834 --> 01:39:39,000
What did you think?

1202
01:39:41,042 --> 01:39:42,726
Good.

1203
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:45,584
Yes, uh Interesting.

1204
01:39:47,042 --> 01:39:49,459
Do you want to - Good

1205
01:39:50,959 --> 01:39:52,601
Good.

1206
01:39:52,625 --> 01:39:54,375
Then I'm finished for the day.

1207
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:08,334
Care for one?

1208
01:40:08,959 --> 01:40:12,125
No, uh, not for me, thanks.

1209
01:40:18,167 --> 01:40:21,417
You see, I am the son of a miner.

1210
01:40:23,042 --> 01:40:25,709
At five o'clock, a miner starts drinking.

1211
01:40:28,959 --> 01:40:30,375
Of course.

1212
01:40:31,084 --> 01:40:32,459
Well, I.

1213
01:40:33,834 --> 01:40:36,000
"I wish you a" the very best with it.

1214
01:40:39,834 --> 01:40:41,042
Go on then.

1215
01:40:43,375 --> 01:40:44,875
Te" me your thoughts.

1216
01:40:46,042 --> 01:40:47,084
Here.

1217
01:40:55,084 --> 01:40:59,310
We", candidly, Richard,
my thoughts are these.

1218
01:40:59,334 --> 01:41:02,268
Firstly, you are not a miner,

1219
01:41:02,292 --> 01:41:04,042
you're an actor.

1220
01:41:04,875 --> 01:41:06,726
You're an actor with three days

1221
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:10,393
to salvage what might be
the opportunity of your career.

1222
01:41:10,417 --> 01:41:13,476
The chance to establish yourself
as a classical actor

1223
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:16,042
in the most prestigious theatre
in the world.

1224
01:41:17,834 --> 01:41:20,875
Do you not understand
the magnitude of that?

1225
01:41:23,209 --> 01:41:24,851
Somewhat - Good.

1226
01:41:24,875 --> 01:41:29,417
Then I propose we find some food
and get down to work.

1227
01:41:31,459 --> 01:41:34,435
"I know you a", and will awhile uphold

1228
01:41:34,459 --> 01:41:37,310
the unyoked humour of your idleness".

1229
01:41:37,334 --> 01:41:39,268
"Yet herein will I imitate the sun."

1230
01:41:39,292 --> 01:41:40,792
Try again.

1231
01:41:47,875 --> 01:41:49,375
"I know you a",

1232
01:41:50,959 --> 01:41:52,893
and will awhile uphold

1233
01:41:52,917 --> 01:41:56,143
the unyoked humour of your idleness".

1234
01:41:56,167 --> 01:41:58,750
"Yet herein will I imitate the sun."

1235
01:42:01,334 --> 01:42:05,226
You understand this character, Richard.

1236
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:11,685
You know that he's not
some thigh-slapping youth.

1237
01:42:11,709 --> 01:42:14,435
Yes, Hal is a young man,

1238
01:42:14,459 --> 01:42:18,851
but he's always aware of his destiny.

1239
01:42:18,875 --> 01:42:20,351
That, on the death of his father,

1240
01:42:20,375 --> 01:42:23,226
he will have to turn away
from Falstaff's irreverence

1241
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:26,685
and the drunken life of the tavern.

1242
01:42:26,709 --> 01:42:31,268
He will transform into a king,

1243
01:42:31,292 --> 01:42:33,060
and, like a king,

1244
01:42:33,084 --> 01:42:37,250
lead his country
as a king must, by example.

1245
01:42:39,417 --> 01:42:42,500
You must trust your instincts, Richard.

1246
01:42:44,417 --> 01:42:46,792
All right, stop Stop, stop!

1247
01:42:47,834 --> 01:42:50,875
I tell you to shout, and you
whisper I tell you to laugh

1248
01:42:51,042 --> 01:42:52,882
I am not some straight man
to your funny lines.

1249
01:42:53,042 --> 01:42:54,518
It is a comic scene.

1250
01:42:54,542 --> 01:42:57,768
We're in the tavern, a world of ribaldry.

1251
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:59,935
Look, why don't you try doing it like.

1252
01:42:59,959 --> 01:43:01,893
There is no other way I will be doing it

1253
01:43:01,917 --> 01:43:03,810
Richard, I am your director!

1254
01:43:03,834 --> 01:43:06,810
And you shall have
my performance Nobody else's.

1255
01:43:06,834 --> 01:43:11,435
Nobody else's? Then what exactly
is <i>he</i> doing here?

1256
01:43:11,459 --> 01:43:14,476
Tony Tony, honestly,
I think you should go with it

1257
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:17,042
I know it's different,
but I think it is working.

1258
01:43:19,167 --> 01:43:21,393
Bloody Welsh.

1259
01:43:21,417 --> 01:43:23,393
Over the Marches you come,
out of the mountains,

1260
01:43:23,417 --> 01:43:26,209
raiding our cattle
You don't come to contribute.

1261
01:43:27,625 --> 01:43:30,375
You're just bloody raiders.

1262
01:43:59,625 --> 01:44:02,018
A grammar school boy.

1263
01:44:02,042 --> 01:44:05,125
Not a prince Not a lord.

1264
01:44:07,209 --> 01:44:09,334
Three hundred years

1265
01:44:10,375 --> 01:44:13,500
and we're still transported by his words.

1266
01:44:17,459 --> 01:44:18,834
Tomorrow, Richie.

1267
01:44:21,959 --> 01:44:23,584
Sound trumpets.

1268
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:28,792
Let our bloody colours wave.

1269
01:44:46,709 --> 01:44:48,000
And either victory

1270
01:44:50,959 --> 01:44:52,417
or else a grave.

1271
01:45:17,709 --> 01:45:19,250
Morning, Rich.

1272
01:45:21,542 --> 01:45:22,750
Tim.

1273
01:45:25,584 --> 01:45:27,209
Your friend's looking for you.

1274
01:45:28,167 --> 01:45:31,000
Your, uh Your acting coach.

1275
01:45:33,792 --> 01:45:35,125
He's not my acting coach.

1276
01:45:36,584 --> 01:45:37,750
Well, then, uh

1277
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:40,250
you know, whoever he is.

1278
01:46:02,417 --> 01:46:05,834
I, uh, thought we might discuss
the coronation scene.

1279
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:12,310
I have a six-hour performance.

1280
01:46:12,334 --> 01:46:13,917
Of course Of course, but

1281
01:46:15,792 --> 01:46:19,226
there's a line towards
the end of the scene

1282
01:46:19,250 --> 01:46:21,768
which underlines
the scale of the transformation

1283
01:46:21,792 --> 01:46:23,209
he has undergone.

1284
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:28,875
I need some air.

1285
01:46:31,375 --> 01:46:32,500
Mr Burton?

1286
01:46:34,292 --> 01:46:35,750
Would you mind signing this?

1287
01:46:45,209 --> 01:46:46,375
Dear me, look at that.

1288
01:46:51,209 --> 01:46:53,250
"What the he" were they thinking?

1289
01:46:57,042 --> 01:46:58,292
Thank you

1290
01:47:07,417 --> 01:47:08,834
Are you still here?

1291
01:47:32,709 --> 01:47:33,875
Richie?

1292
01:47:35,959 --> 01:47:38,459
Yes What is it?

1293
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:40,875
What do you mean?

1294
01:47:41,042 --> 01:47:43,667
I have been waiting for you
for nearly two hours.

1295
01:47:44,542 --> 01:47:47,709
Yes And I will be along
when I'm good and ready

1296
01:47:48,709 --> 01:47:54,435
Richie, I remind you,
I was summoned here to help you.

1297
01:47:54,459 --> 01:47:55,851
I, too, am a busy man.

1298
01:47:55,875 --> 01:47:57,584
Do you think you can just turn up

1299
01:47:59,167 --> 01:48:00,709
after eight years?

1300
01:48:01,584 --> 01:48:05,560
Eight bloody years And
and have me do your bidding?

1301
01:48:05,584 --> 01:48:07,459
Like I'm your schoolboy again?

1302
01:48:08,167 --> 01:48:11,435
Richie I cannot talk here Let's go away.

1303
01:48:11,459 --> 01:48:13,250
Just who the hell do you think you are?

1304
01:48:14,959 --> 01:48:16,851
I am one of the most promising
young actors

1305
01:48:16,875 --> 01:48:18,417
in this whole bloody country.

1306
01:48:20,542 --> 01:48:21,667
And you?

1307
01:48:22,834 --> 01:48:24,125
Remind me.

1308
01:48:25,084 --> 01:48:26,667
Who are you?

1309
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:49,935
Oh, Richie.

1310
01:48:49,959 --> 01:48:52,643
Oh, Richie - Ma.

1311
01:48:52,667 --> 01:48:56,084
Oh, it's so wonderful to see you.

1312
01:48:56,750 --> 01:48:58,042
I know.

1313
01:48:59,167 --> 01:49:01,310
Mr Burton telephoned yesterday

1314
01:49:01,334 --> 01:49:03,226
and so I told him
that we'd keep it a surprise.

1315
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:05,643
But he's managed to get me a ticket.

1316
01:49:05,667 --> 01:49:07,351
Oh, Richie, you must be so proud.

1317
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:09,560
He said it was all he could do
just to get the one,

1318
01:49:09,584 --> 01:49:12,226
what with both of you
working on the play, so.

1319
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:13,292
Yes.

1320
01:49:15,042 --> 01:49:16,768
Isn't this a wonderful place?

1321
01:49:16,792 --> 01:49:19,518
Mr Burton has told me so much about it

1322
01:49:19,542 --> 01:49:21,792
I can't believe I'm really here.

1323
01:49:22,625 --> 01:49:23,834
Oh, Richie.

1324
01:49:25,167 --> 01:49:28,584
<i>If all the year
were playing holidays</i>

1325
01:49:30,334 --> 01:49:34,000
<i>to sport would be as tedious as to work.</i>

1326
01:49:35,875 --> 01:49:39,000
<i>So when this loose behaviour I throw off,</i>

1327
01:49:42,834 --> 01:49:45,334
<i>and pay the debt I never promised</i>

1328
01:49:53,042 --> 01:49:56,459
<i>By how much better than my word I am</i>

1329
01:50:46,792 --> 01:50:48,250
I'm sorry.

1330
01:50:49,959 --> 01:50:51,334
I'm so sorry.

1331
01:50:55,292 --> 01:50:57,000
It's unforgivable what I said.

1332
01:50:59,042 --> 01:51:01,000
Unforgivable and entirely untrue.

1333
01:51:09,542 --> 01:51:10,834
I was drunk.

1334
01:51:15,375 --> 01:51:16,417
Again.

1335
01:51:19,875 --> 01:51:21,292
It was no excuse.

1336
01:51:24,959 --> 01:51:26,500
I owe you

1337
01:51:28,834 --> 01:51:30,000
everything.

1338
01:51:34,084 --> 01:51:35,810
I've never said it to you

1339
01:51:35,834 --> 01:51:37,167
I've never even

1340
01:51:38,959 --> 01:51:40,834
apologised So.

1341
01:51:41,792 --> 01:51:46,143
So, I thank you and I apologise now.

1342
01:51:46,167 --> 01:51:47,334
Truly, with all my heart.

1343
01:52:02,292 --> 01:52:03,500
I'm afraid.

1344
01:52:06,125 --> 01:52:07,792
I am I'm afraid.

1345
01:52:09,625 --> 01:52:11,125
I'm not like you.

1346
01:52:12,042 --> 01:52:13,667
I'm just a bloody fake.

1347
01:52:17,584 --> 01:52:18,917
I'm half an actor.

1348
01:52:21,042 --> 01:52:26,560
And I'm jealous and proud
and selfish and spiteful.

1349
01:52:26,584 --> 01:52:29,375
And you are everything.

1350
01:52:31,334 --> 01:52:33,417
You're strong Truly, you are.

1351
01:52:34,417 --> 01:52:37,292
And this play, PH

1352
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:43,209
this is everything we worked for.

1353
01:52:44,417 --> 01:52:45,792
And I'm terrified.

1354
01:52:49,542 --> 01:52:50,750
I'm terrified.

1355
01:53:00,834 --> 01:53:02,209
Please.

1356
01:53:03,959 --> 01:53:05,542
Help me.

1357
01:53:08,625 --> 01:53:10,042
Come back

1358
01:53:22,209 --> 01:53:23,417
I have to go

1359
01:54:53,459 --> 01:54:56,917
Now, Hal,
what time of day is it, lad?

1360
01:55:06,959 --> 01:55:08,334
Thou

1361
01:55:11,792 --> 01:55:17,250
art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack

1362
01:55:18,459 --> 01:55:21,060
that thou hast forgotten
to demand that truly

1363
01:55:21,084 --> 01:55:23,310
which thou wouldst truly know.

1364
01:55:23,334 --> 01:55:26,310
What a devil hast thou to do
with the time of day?

1365
01:55:26,334 --> 01:55:30,685
Unless hours were cups of sack,
and minutes capons,

1366
01:55:30,709 --> 01:55:32,476
and clocks the tongues of bawds

1367
01:55:42,834 --> 01:55:45,351
Do not think so; You shall not find it so.

1368
01:55:45,375 --> 01:55:48,101
And God forgive them
that so much have swayed.

1369
01:55:48,125 --> 01:55:49,935
Your Majesty's good thoughts
away from me.

1370
01:55:49,959 --> 01:55:52,000
To tell you that I am your son.

1371
01:55:56,959 --> 01:56:00,625
Why doth the crown lie there
upon his pillow,

1372
01:56:03,125 --> 01:56:06,209
being so troublesome a bedfellow?

1373
01:56:07,750 --> 01:56:09,792
Oh, polished perturbation.

1374
01:56:12,042 --> 01:56:13,250
Golden care

1375
01:56:15,209 --> 01:56:19,060
<i>that keep'st the ports
of slumber open wide</i>

1376
01:56:19,084 --> 01:56:21,667
<i>to many a watchful night.</i>

1377
01:56:24,584 --> 01:56:28,500
My King, my Jove,
I speak to thee, my heart.

1378
01:56:31,084 --> 01:56:33,042
I know thee not, old man.

1379
01:56:36,542 --> 01:56:37,834
Fa" to thy prayers.

1380
01:56:43,125 --> 01:56:47,584
How ill white hairs
become a fool and a jester.

1381
01:56:54,750 --> 01:56:57,834
I have long dreamt of such a kind of man.

1382
01:56:59,917 --> 01:57:01,084
But being awaked,

1383
01:57:02,584 --> 01:57:05,084
I do despise my dream

1384
01:58:16,042 --> 01:58:17,250
Bravo!

1385
01:58:40,042 --> 01:58:42,101
Wonderful, thank you

1386
01:58:44,125 --> 01:58:46,643
Of course

1387
01:58:49,709 --> 01:58:51,000
Richie.

1388
01:58:52,042 --> 01:58:53,834
Act Five, Scene Five.

1389
01:58:55,917 --> 01:58:58,209
The modulation of your voice It was.

1390
01:58:59,959 --> 01:59:03,375
Well, your stillness, it was really.

1391
01:59:08,792 --> 01:59:10,875
Uh, I was really.

1392
01:59:12,625 --> 01:59:15,625
Well, I, uh, I have never.

1393
01:59:39,917 --> 01:59:41,084
What?

1394
01:59:45,084 --> 01:59:47,542
Can a man not hug
his own bloody father?

1395
02:01:34,209 --> 02:01:38,292
-
