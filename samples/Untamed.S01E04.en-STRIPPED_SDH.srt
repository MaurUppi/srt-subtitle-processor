1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,804
And we're sure this is our Jane Doe?

2
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:16,266
That's her. It was my case,
Lucy Cook's abduction.

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,268
She disappeared from her father's house.

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,730
No sign of forced entry,
no trail to follow.

5
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,314
So where's Abuelo?

6
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,859
He's on a spiritual walkabout.

7
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,819
-What's your name?
-Don't talk to her.

8
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:28,737
Tell me.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,488
Where you coming in from, Shane?

10
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,866
It's funny you should turn up
looking for Abuelo

11
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,284
around the same time as me.

12
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,454
Yeah, well, who's to say?
The world's full of coincidences.

13
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,581
Did his father get in touch with you?

14
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,542
-His father?
-Yeah, he called today.

15
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,546
Were you close with Maggie Cook
back in the day?

16
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,715
Yeah, of course we were friendly.

17
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,551
Well, that girl who went off El Capitan
was her daughter.

18
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,469
Lucy?

19
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,014
Jesus! Fuck!

20
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,024
I found it up top.

21
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,652
You just may have stumbled
on something, Ranger Vasquez.

22
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,240
Can I help you?

23
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,914
Hold up! I just want to talk!

24
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,621
You shouldn't keep helping them, Lu.

25
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,666
They're bad people.

26
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,377
Who isn't?

27
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:56,968
You!

28
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:00,180
I rally all who are chosen
Who don't let society hold them 

29
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:04,184
Asylum for the hurt and the broken
Precious metal, I am golden 

30
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,770
Of the moon and the sun
Where I'm from is outside of the matrix 

31
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,566
It has begun, revolution
We gotta say this 

32
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,159
Call it what you want
Call it what you need 

33
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:25,205
There's a shift
There's a glitch in this rеality 

34
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,249
Now it's up to us
Now it's up to me 

35
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:32,128
To invoke what was spoken
Through thе air that we breathe 

36
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,618
I'm not sure I understand.

37
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,536
I mean, I get these three.

38
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,163
X marks the spot and all.

39
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,250
But how are you connecting
the guy from the river with them?

40
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,337
Where does Teddy Redwine fit?

41
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,173
Well, anyone looking
for weed inside the park

42
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,133
would usually find their way to Teddy.

43
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,844
He was into other shit as well,
but nothing too heavy.

44
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,306
I went and saw him to see
if he knew anything about the pills.

45
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,226
Put the squeeze on him
to find out what he could.

46
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,353
Next, he's getting pulled
out of the water.

47
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,480
It was a bad move by me
jamming him into it.

48
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,774
So Teddy, Lucy, the drugs.

49
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,485
You think this Abuelo guy
could be behind all of it?

50
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,029
Did you hear back from your friend
in Mariposa PD?

51
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,240
They seen any of those pills there?

52
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,159
Said they're starting to see more,
but no idea of the source.

53
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,954
-We heading back to that mine?
-I am.

54
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,415
What, I get a time-out
'cause of yesterday?

55
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,334
You tell me what happens
if I hadn't found a horse missing.

56
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,420
Gosh, Dad, I don't know. Nothing good.

57
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,672
I told you I screwed up.

58
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,258
I won't sneak the family car out again
without asking.

59
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,761
Someone told me
you should never go in those places alone!

60
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,393
There's some extra gear in the box.

61
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,815
Would help out in the parking lot?

62
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,989
I was hoping to slip out and have lunch
with my granddaughter today.

63
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,576
We could turn off the lights,
wait for them to go away.

64
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,161
That'll help.

65
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,338
If you're waiting for a ball game
to break out, I got two bad knees.

66
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,840
Oh. Oh, yeah, no. Uh…

67
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,384
I work at Foot Locker up in Tahoe.

68
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,344
Uh-huh.

69
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,221
Um, sorry. I came down because, uh…

70
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,725
I knew Lucy Cook when she was little.

71
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,937
I don't know what to do with that.
Sorry for your loss.

72
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,607
Oh, no, no, no. It's not like that.

73
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,151
I haven't seen her in…
I don't know. A long time.

74
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,986
Um…

75
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,655
Are you working on her case?
The disappearance?

76
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,574
No, that'd be Agent Turner,

77
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:10,203
but he's sort of moved on
to the next horrible phase of her life.

78
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,954
And he's not here.

79
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,207
Um, well, can I wait for him?

80
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,376
Sure. Yeah.

81
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,796
Yeah, he'd love to talk to you.

82
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,799
Nice guy. And it's his birthday today.

83
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,092
Okay.

84
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,176
Thank you very much.

85
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,928
Yeah, thank you.

86
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,228
Nice and easy.

87
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,688
Don't want to go down there again.

88
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,316
Okay.

89
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,568
The ground should be stable here,

90
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,571
but if it gives a little
just step back, okay?

91
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,531
Okay.

92
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,871
This is what? An old gold mine?

93
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,874
Probably been here since, like, 1850s.

94
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,544
Thousands of these
abandoned around the state.

95
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,922
-I didn't know this one existed.
-Lucky for us, I found it, huh?

96
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,884
It would definitely make for
a good place to hide.

97
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,179
Yeah. Or to be doing
something you shouldn't.

98
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,268
These are all connected somehow.
It's like an underground tunnel system.

99
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,775
Watch out for rusty nails, hey.

100
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,905
Temperature's way up down here.

101
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,076
Air's not going to be great.
Probably traces of arsenic.

102
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,994
Arsenic?

103
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,247
The bad guys use ventilators
and we get nothing?

104
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,588
Hold on.

105
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:46,841
What is that?

106
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,094
What? Is it a cave-in?

107
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,429
Close your eyes.

108
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,476
Fuck! What?!

109
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,534
Ah!

110
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,454
Oh! You never said anything about bats!

111
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,830
Watch out for bats.

112
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,932
Using the mines to run product?

113
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,391
That would be the bet.

114
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,605
We're still inside the park here, right?

115
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:46,317
Yeah. Looks like a shortcut
through the mountain.

116
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,532
Found something.

117
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,039
Animals got to it.

118
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,584
Vultures. Picked it clean.

119
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,421
I don't think Abuelo's
coming back from his walkabout.

120
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,308
This is Turner. I got something for you.

121
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,604
Single turkey vulture
working on the maxilla bone there.

122
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,982
A couple ravens
showed up to crash the party.

123
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,403
What's your best guess
on how long this has been here?

124
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,654
Five or six days?

125
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,948
Looks longer than that.

126
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,618
Yeah, vultures accelerate decay.
It can throw off a timeline.

127
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,829
This, definitely inside a week.

128
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,790
Think you can find me
some more of the remains?

129
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,209
Oh. It might take a while.

130
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,878
Can't we just look
for birds circling around?

131
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,672
You must be new here. Is she new?

132
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,215
-LA.
-Ah.

133
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,135
It's a misconception
that vultures circle the dead.

134
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,429
They're too large
to flap their wings to fly,

135
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,931
so they find air thermals
to help them soar.

136
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,517
If you want a vulture to help find a body,

137
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,062
you need to look lower,
so tree branches, fence posts.

138
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,399
-This needs to be a ground search.
-You stay here with Morris.

139
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,360
You're leaving me with…

140
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,237
Let me know if you find something.

141
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,909
Vultures aren't equipped to hunt,

142
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,954
which makes them
the only animals in the world

143
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,332
that depend on death as a food source.

144
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:28,502
They hone in on the chemicals
that are released during decay.

145
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,922
They descend to the remains,
and they begin to feast.

146
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:36,802
They start with the eyes,
then the skin, tissues.

147
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,846
Always leave the spine.

148
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,390
They really are amazing creatures.

149
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,478
Wish I loved anything
as much as you love these birds.

150
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,483
Now what vultures love more than anything…

151
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,277
brains.

152
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,030
That's brains?

153
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,907
Crystalline.

154
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,077
Roughly a week old, I'd say.

155
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,692
What do you think, Ranger Vasquez?
Forty-five caliber?

156
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,443
Very close range.

157
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,029
Execution style.

158
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,031
As he was standing against that tree.

159
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,243
Wow.

160
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,748
We found him.

161
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,551
Let's tidy up some for our guest.

162
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,098
All alone?

163
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,810
What? You send your little sidekick
back to LA?

164
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,481
Vultures did a number on him.

165
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,651
Rest of Abuelo's
half-buried in a shallow grave.

166
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,572
You know, he was kind of depressed
when he left here.

167
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,075
Guess he decided to punch his own ticket.

168
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,286
Bury himself before pulling the trigger?

169
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,413
Halfway, you said.

170
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,332
Like most things Abuelo did.

171
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,878
The way I remember,
you two were a couple at one point.

172
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,881
Well, that just means
that I would wake up every morning

173
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,091
and hope that he would die.

174
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,968
Not that I would actually kill him.

175
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,846
Well, reason to think
the person who shot him

176
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,974
might be responsible for
a couple other recent deaths in the park.

177
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,895
Aw, hell!

178
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,565
You called in the cavalry,
did you, Turner?

179
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,818
Just wanted to take a look around.
Make sure none of you in danger.

180
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,779
We are perfectly safe.

181
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:06,660
You can't just bust in on…
on people's property like this.

182
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,663
These are our personal belongings.

183
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,000
We have constitutional rights!

184
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,169
Glory, you picked the one spot
to pitch a tent

185
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,004
the constitution will not help you.

186
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,826
So, how is Glory's bunch here involved?

187
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,037
It's all connected somehow.
Lucy Cook, the drugs,

188
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,123
Teddy, now Abuelo.

189
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,377
Just need to find something
to convince Glory

190
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,962
to help us fill in the blanks.

191
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,340
Found these. Under a fucking bedpan.

192
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,385
Why would they have a bedpan out here?

193
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,011
Just to dump it in the woods?

194
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,265
Skip the fucking middleman, you know?

195
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,310
This your recycling?

196
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,735
Is that for me or you?

197
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,238
Get through this,
you and I can split one after.

198
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,284
Where'd you get these?

199
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:29,827
Couldn't say.

200
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,830
Let's say Abuelo gave these to you.

201
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:36,375
Abuelo was not known
for his altruistic tendencies.

202
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,877
He didn't give me anything.

203
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,671
Oh, except for a lingering case of herpes.

204
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,549
Well, let's say he sold these to you.
Where'd he get them?

205
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,259
I wish I knew. I'd get more.

206
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,637
And you got no interest in helping us
find the people who murdered him?

207
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,847
Good riddance.

208
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,350
Abuelo was an asshole.

209
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,647
And that… that young girl
who went off El Capitan…

210
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,732
Lucy Cook?

211
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,651
Whatever. That's just a name.

212
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,863
She doesn't mean anything to me.

213
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,323
The same as Abuelo.

214
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,034
That's a cold way
to look at things, Glory.

215
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,916
For over two decades,
I worked the same job.

216
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,835
I was very good at it. Better than most.

217
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:26,300
And then, um,
a week after my 50th birthday,

218
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,929
I was not so gently kicked out the door.

219
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:34,266
They even misspelled my name
on the termination letter.

220
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,353
And then, a short time later,

221
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,605
the doctor tells me I've got cancer,

222
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:43,484
but no insurance to do anything about it.

223
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,986
So I figured, fuck it.

224
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,073
If I'm gonna die,

225
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:55,079
let's do it far away from the real world
as I can get.

226
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,959
Where there's no more fake sympathy

227
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,919
from nurses or doctors

228
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:05,547
or the insurance voices
saying how sorry they are

229
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,883
while they look at their watches,

230
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:13,097
hurrying on to the next sad story
with a social security number.

231
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,606
That… was nine years ago.

232
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,653
And I'm still kicking.

233
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,364
Barely, sometimes.

234
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,117
Days where…

235
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,411
I hurt enough

236
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,455
or I am scared enough

237
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,708
that I will try just about anything.

238
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,673
Except fake sympathy…

239
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,301
for girls that I don't know

240
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,886
or men that I don't like.

241
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,098
So forgive me, Agent Turner,

242
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,977
if my tone lacks
a certain degree of warmth.

243
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,857
That's what honesty sounds like.

244
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,361
What you sound like.

245
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,919
Let her go.

246
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,965
Well, that was shocking,
especially as she's always been

247
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,885
so happy to cooperate with us in the past.

248
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,429
We'll keep the rest overnight,

249
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:39,683
see if any want to give us something
to help them get back out into the wild.

250
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,602
Let me do some background checks,

251
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,771
see if we can find something to leverage.

252
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,522
Speaking of background…

253
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,401
Here's Lucy Cook's DNA results
that you asked for.

254
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,111
They came to me for some reason.

255
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,447
Any interesting threads?

256
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,448
Just one.

257
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,705
No Rory Cook?

258
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,333
He would have been in the system.
He should be in there.

259
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,002
Unless he wasn't the father.

260
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,755
Any talk of that back then?

261
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:13,133
There's no way that he would have
taken Lucy in after Maggie died,

262
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,260
if he'd known he wasn't her dad.

263
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,096
Hmm.

264
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,556
Let's see where
some of these names lead us.

265
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,184
Anyway, I'm not sure
that it matters now that, uh,

266
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,020
everything seems to be
leaning in a drug-deal direction.

267
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,732
Maybe not for her death, but it could
for what happened back then.

268
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,651
-Agent Turner!
-Yeah?

269
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,528
There's some kid waiting for you.

270
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,155
-What's he want?
-Something about Lucy Cook.

271
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,081
Can I help you?

272
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,250
-Oh, Agent Turner?
-Yeah.

273
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,044
Yeah, I'm Matt Sturge. Nice to meet you.

274
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,463
I was told to wait for you.
Uh, happy birthday.

275
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,968
The other ranger,
he told me it was your birthday.

276
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,136
What do you need?

277
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,971
It's about Grace McRay.

278
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,850
I'm sorry, Lucy Cook.
She was Grace when I knew her.

279
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,017
I don't follow you.

280
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,228
So I grew up over in Yelton.

281
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,439
It's a little anthill of a town
across the line in Nevada.

282
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,816
I saw in the news about her.

283
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,068
I'm pretty sure she lived
down the street from me.

284
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,820
-Lucy Cook?
-Yeah.

285
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,156
With a pastor's family.

286
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,449
See, I went to their church, so…

287
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,911
Uh, she looked a little different.
Hair and stuff, but…

288
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,080
I'd put money on that being her, for sure.

289
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,124
And that's me, right there next to her.

290
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,378
Hmm. With a little imagination, maybe.

291
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:36,091
-When was the last time you saw her?
-I don't know. Maybe ten years or so.

292
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,093
Pastor Gibbs and his wife said back then

293
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,262
that she left to go live
with her real family.

294
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,764
They say where this real family was?

295
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,767
No. Just sort of got forgotten about.

296
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,894
Like Grace there.

297
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,520
You mind if I hold on to that?

298
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,897
Uh, yeah. Sure. Yeah.

299
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,898
Um…

300
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,859
And also, there's… articles,

301
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,737
online, about a reward
that was being passed out

302
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,157
for information about
her disappearance. $10,000.

303
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,116
Here we go.

304
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,368
Not really missing anymore.

305
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,871
Yeah, well, I thought since
nobody collected before,

306
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,373
there still might be some left over.

307
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,752
This man here will take care
of all your reward details.

308
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,796
Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you.

309
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,008
Okay.

310
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,422
Please don't run.

311
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,468
I really don't want to have to
chase you down on this thing.

312
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,058
Yeah, Lucy used to go in that mine a lot.

313
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,311
What would she do in there?

314
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,107
Forget who she was.

315
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,567
Become someone else.

316
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,404
Someone without all her pain.

317
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,781
You met here in the park?

318
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,534
Yeah, when we were, like, 16.

319
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,577
Not long after I got here.

320
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,871
And Lucy was already here?

321
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,666
Yeah, yeah. She had a…

322
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,711
a tent somewhere out
in the middle of nowhere,

323
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,421
where no one could find her.

324
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,338
You did.

325
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,925
Well, no, she found me.

326
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,178
It was nice back then.

327
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,307
Felt like we had
the whole world to ourselves.

328
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,518
How long had she been out here?

329
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,646
I think she grew up around the park
until her mom died,

330
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,276
and then… she ran away
from some other place after that.

331
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,903
We had a spot up on Garrison Ridge,

332
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,197
and we were there for a few years.

333
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,366
And then, um…

334
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,619
Lucy got a crush on some guy,

335
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,998
and started being… gone a lot.

336
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,333
Sometimes for days.

337
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,627
What was the guy's name?

338
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,255
Terces.

339
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,800
That's what she called him. It's…

340
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,636
It's "secret" spelled backwards.

341
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,601
Lucy had all kinds of secrets,
but… that one was her favorite.

342
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,729
I mean, God knows why. He's…

343
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:40,025
He's not a nice guy.
He got her into all sorts of bad shit.

344
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,321
And after that, when I'd see her,
she'd either be carrying drugs or cash,

345
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,823
just depending on
which direction she was going.

346
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,867
Did you ever go with her?

347
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,954
See who she was working for?
Where they were?

348
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,581
No, ma'am.

349
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,541
That shit scared me.

350
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:01,588
I remember she'd come back
all, like, beat up sometimes.

351
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:05,175
And, uh, one day she left,
and she never came back.

352
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,887
Did you see Lucy again after that?

353
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:13,767
Maybe in the distance sometimes
when she was dealing with Abuelo.

354
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:19,231
Uh, they had a spot in this gulch
where she would go drop drugs,

355
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,316
and he'd swap it out for cash and…

356
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,112
I saw her near there,
like, maybe a week or so ago,

357
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,657
and she was carrying the bag
that she uses for deliveries.

358
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,741
She was alone?

359
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,868
Yeah.

360
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,873
What about someone else
who worked with Abuelo?

361
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,668
He was with Pakuna a lot.

362
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,336
Pakuna?

363
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:42,671
Yeah.

364
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,257
-He lived with you guys?
-He was friends with Abuelo.

365
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,135
They'd go do their walkabouts together.

366
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,140
I should clear out too.

367
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,517
You need somewhere to stay?

368
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,769
I got places, ma'am.

369
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,993
Can you tell me where that gulch is?

370
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,246
Where Lucy and Abuelo would make the swap?

371
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,006
Had it buried out there, but it was empty.

372
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:29,009
And the girl?
She saw Lucy Cook make the drop?

373
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:29,968
Yeah.

374
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,722
If that buzzard dude's math is right,
Abuelo was already dead.

375
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,599
So someone else knew it was there.

376
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,436
Could be this other squatter
she told me about. Pakuna.

377
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,855
Said he was the closest
of their bunch with Abuelo.

378
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,607
He's refused to talk so far,

379
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,692
but we're still
holding him at the station.

380
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:49,404
He might know who Lucy and Abuelo
were moving product for.

381
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,867
Well, whoever they are,
their operation would have to be

382
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,161
on the east side of the mine.

383
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,415
Maybe we take a chopper tomorrow.
Take a look around.

384
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,876
-If we get lucky, we might spot something.
-Hmm.

385
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,128
Where'd all this stuff come from?

386
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,714
It's from the house Lucy Cook grew up in.

387
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,894
She always looked so happy.

388
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,647
Man, life can change in a blink.

389
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,942
I'm gonna go pick up my kid.
See you tomorrow.

390
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,339
In a blink.

391
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,191
Jim Beam.

392
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:16,283
Celebrating your special occasions
in public now, huh?

393
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,285
I admire that.

394
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,288
We are who we are.

395
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,961
What do you know about Abuelo?

396
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,797
Just that he's dead.

397
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,883
I need to find myself a new witch doctor.

398
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,343
Quick.

399
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,179
Any thoughts on who killed him?

400
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,560
Abuelo dealt so much shit,
the list of possibles is long.

401
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,814
What was your cut?

402
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,359
I'm not sure I follow.

403
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,737
You're wildlife management, right?

404
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,238
Yeah, not that wild.

405
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,034
Maybe the occasional discount
for looking the other way, but…

406
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,537
What about his supplier?

407
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,623
The one with the X?

408
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,709
What was your deal with them?

409
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,506
Beyond the point of entry, Kyle,
that is outside of my jurisdiction.

410
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,385
You've never been one
to turn away free money.

411
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,847
Maybe if I know who to send a bill to,
I would've, but…

412
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,143
like I said, I'm just a loyal customer.

413
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,189
Hey, speaking of interesting info,

414
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,692
that, uh, that Jane Doe of yours
who took a header off El Capitan,

415
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,611
she's a real miracle child, huh?

416
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,990
Comes roaring back to life
like Jesus Christ himself.

417
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,869
Just took 15 years instead of three days.

418
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,208
Maybe you'll do better on the case
this time around.

419
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,051
French fries are my favorite.

420
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,387
Me too. Don't tell anyone, though.

421
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,264
Mommy's gonna make us a spinach smoothie,
cover our tracks.

422
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,226
Come on. Whoop.

423
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,689
Okay, come on. Oop. Bah-bah-bah.

424
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,902
Wash your hands and you can help me.

425
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,412
Mommy, look.

426
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,415
It lights up.

427
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,835
Where did you get that?

428
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:34,838
Gael!

429
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,175
Hey, Mommy.

430
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,057
Gael, come over here to me.

431
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,440
You shouldn't be here.

432
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,109
I'm just checking out the area.

433
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,862
You didn't tell me you were heading here.

434
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,448
I'm pretty sure
my lip was too swollen to talk.

435
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,283
That shit again?

436
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,622
Well, you give as good as you take, Naya.

437
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,710
It's time for bed, Gael.

438
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,546
Hey. I'll put him in.

439
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,964
He needs a bath first.

440
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,926
-Tell your father bye. He needs to leave.
-Where am I going?

441
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,095
Up to you, but not staying here.

442
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:28,475
Well, as you know, I'm not exactly
bringing in a regular paycheck right now.

443
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,977
-So unless you pay for my hotel--
-You need to go back to LA.

444
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,312
Hey, that sounds great.

445
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,814
You two come with me.

446
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,234
And while you're there,
you can tell those IA fucks

447
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,195
I had nothing to do
with that asshole's money.

448
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,696
I'm not lying for you.

449
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,284
I need my badge back, Naya.

450
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,038
Otherwise, what am I supposed to do?

451
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,916
Not my problem.

452
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,667
Maybe.

453
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,545
Maybe not.

454
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,547
Hey, come here, G-man.

455
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,593
You like that?

456
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,472
That's a cool one, huh, G-man?

457
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,811
Get your hand off him.

458
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,777
Only three of us were in
that cooker's apartment, Naya.

459
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,071
Me, you, and Rowell.

460
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,701
You back my story… it's two to one.

461
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,705
They got no proof of anything,
and I'm back on my job.

462
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,542
You got it?

463
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:41,297
Gael, go turn on the tub.
Give me the car. I'll be right there.

464
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,341
You can play with it after.

465
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,062
I stay here tonight.

466
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:59,148
We all go down tomorrow,
and then this is all over.

467
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:00,942
Fine.

468
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,112
Then we never see you again.

469
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,660
If you come near either of us tonight,
I'll shoot you in the fucking head.

470
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,453
I swear to God.

471
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,250
Naya…

472
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,837
I mean,

473
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,632
not exactly the warm reunion
I was hoping for.

474
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,472
Mommy!

475
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:33,808
Coming.

476
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,608
Not too hot.

477
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,595
Ayo, G-man.

478
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,766
Hey, remember we used to play
that bath ball game with--

479
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,062
Gael!

480
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,402
It's okay, baby. Stay down.

481
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,200
Hey, that bullet come back?

482
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,577
I shoot whoever you thought I did?

483
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,164
I'm not sure yet.

484
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:41,000
Tell me who got shot,
I'll tell you if it's mine, but…

485
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,461
you know me, Kyle.

486
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,673
Not in the habit of shooting people
unless I'm getting paid for it.

487
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,928
Back in Kabul, we used to throw
100 bucks in a pot,

488
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,930
me and the snipers, for which of us--

489
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,014
Did you know her?

490
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,435
The girl.

491
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,729
Lucy Cook.

492
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,610
Kyle,

493
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,697
you and me talking like this
about dead bodies,

494
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,533
it's almost like
we're working together again.

495
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,077
We've never worked together.

496
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,495
Tomato, tomahto.

497
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,873
If you're in this somehow,

498
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,459
I'm gonna find out.

499
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:27,922
Then what, Kyle?

500
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,678
No, I'm curious.

501
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:38,266
Exactly what the fuck
would you do about it?

502
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,729
Hey, uh…

503
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,483
Esther Avalos.

504
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:52,488
Got a hell of a cute smile.
But boy, does she ask a lot of questions.

505
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,743
Mainly about you, by the way.

506
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,498
Wonder what you must have done
to pique her interest so.

507
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,419
I told her it'd been a few years,
I'd have to think about it,

508
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,879
see what I could remember.

509
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:15,762
What do you think I should remember
about that Sanderson fellow, Kyle?

510
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,015
When was the first time I saw him, or…

511
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,434
maybe when was the last time?

512
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,359
I just love this song.

513
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,195
Who is this exactly?

514
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,949
Ah, never mind. You two are too young
to appreciate the finer things.

515
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,828
Kyle, can I borrow you for a moment?

516
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,540
Just in time.

517
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,418
-Good to see you, Shane.
-You too, Paul.

518
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,838
Say hi to Jill, Kyle.

519
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,009
Keep going, buddy.

520
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,018
What, you're coming home with me now?

521
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:08,564
Well, if I was, I'd sure as hell
be holding those keys and not you.

522
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,697
Why am I missing a spark plug? Really?

523
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,035
I'm sure it'll turn up
when you're ready to go.

524
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,411
Oh, I'm ready to go now.

525
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,747
How do you think this ends?

526
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,917
Find out what happened to her.

527
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,380
I'm not talking about Lucy Cook.
I'm talking about you, this right here.

528
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,798
I don't know, Paul.

529
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,176
What do you want me to say?

530
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,097
It wasn't your fault.

531
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:45,434
Not Caleb, not Lucy,
not the kid from the bait store.

532
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,477
None of it!

533
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,397
So at some point,
you have to stop torturing yourself.

534
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,314
You have to.

535
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,317
And if that means taking a break
from this place, then so be it.

536
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,569
I'm not leaving here.

537
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,529
I'm not leaving him.

538
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:01,868
That part of Caleb that you hang on to,
that'll be with you wherever you go,

539
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,412
whether it's Glacier or Acadia.

540
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:08,875
But you have to stop
beating yourself to death with memories.

541
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,669
Yeah.

542
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,714
Maybe after.

543
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,010
But I owe this girl.

544
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,431
Do something right by her.

545
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,270
Thanks.

546
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,985
Wasn't sure if you're in the mood
for steak or chicken,

547
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,654
but, you know, back in the day
when I was doing it too hard,

548
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:43,159
there's nothing like banana cream pie
to clear the fog.

549
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,930
You want to tell me
what that was with Maguire?

550
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,267
No.

551
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,104
Okay.

552
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,292
There's a restraining order,
so he's not supposed to come near us.

553
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,588
I thought moving up here might be better.

554
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,884
He's naturally lazy, so I figured
the drive wouldn't be worth it to him.

555
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,221
I thought you said
he had no real interest in you two.

556
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,305
He doesn't.

557
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,308
Not for him.

558
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,436
It's just a power move.

559
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,773
Letting me know he'll do what he wants
unless I help clear him.

560
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,777
You still thirsty? Can I get him a drink?

561
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,071
Yeah. Bourbon's behind the coffee.

562
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,406
Ha-ha-ha.

563
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,997
You're so close.

564
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,380
How old are you?

565
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:21,924
Four?

566
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,592
You like being four?

567
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,721
Enjoy it. It gets harder.

568
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,183
-You have a lot of boxes.
-I like boxes.

569
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,774
No, no. Not that box.

570
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,530
All right. Gael, here. Have some water.

571
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,701
All right. We gotta go to bed now.

572
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,704
It's okay we steal your couch?

573
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,041
I'll get something figured out
for tomorrow.

574
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,280
-You sure you don't mind?
-Are you kidding me? I love this.

575
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,241
I told Kyle I wasn't gonna go in today so…

576
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,619
Thank you so much.
I'll grab him as soon as we get back.

577
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,662
No rush. We'll just be here.

578
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,707
All right, playing,
maybe we'll go take a walk

579
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,084
and see what we find.

580
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,418
Raccoons?

581
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,878
Do you like raccoons?

582
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,963
Okay, then no. No raccoons.

583
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,965
Okay, you be good for Miss Jill, okay?

584
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,010
Uh-hee-hee.

585
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,929
Let me grab my stuff.

586
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,975
Nice of you to do this.

587
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,104
Oh, please. Thanks… for asking me.

588
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,230
Bye, Gael!

589
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,015
Anything?

590
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,436
Just more trees. Lots of them.

591
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,698
That greenblood the girl told you
was close to Abuelo…

592
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,366
Pakuna.

593
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,119
I want you to reach out to Milch.
Have him pull him out.

594
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,121
-You wanna ask him some questions?
-No.

595
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,166
I want him to take him back
to the meadow and cut him loose.

596
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,127
No supplies. No food.
No water. No nothing.

597
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:05,880
Copy.

598
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,101
Which one of you is Gary Horowitz?

599
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,436
It's Pakuna.

600
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,607
Means "deer jumping downhill."

601
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,317
Yeah? Good for you.

602
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,069
Bruce Milch. Means "I don't give a shit."

603
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,488
Let's go.

604
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,366
There's nothing here.

605
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,203
Just as God intended.

606
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,539
What am I supposed to do now?

607
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,626
I don't know, Pakuna.
Go get a fucking job.

608
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,600
Sunshine beating on the good times 

609
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,102
Moonlight raising from the grave 

610
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,189
String band playing
Worn-out honky-tonks 

611
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,983
Pretty young thing
Going dancing in the rain 

612
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,623
High-heel lady
Spitting at the Nickajacks 

613
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,917
Businessman with a needle and a spoon 

614
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,045
Coyote chewing on a cigarette 

615
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,798
Pack o' young boys
Going howlin' at the moon 

616
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:34,009
Hey darlin'
Sleeping on the blacktop 

617
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,971
Hey darlin'
Running through the trees, honey 

618
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,139
Hey darlin'
Leaving for the next town 

619
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,017
Less'n my sense catches up with me 

620
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,445
Three dead in a crash on the number 4 

621
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,823
Two witnesses below and up high 

622
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,409
Not sure whose will be done 

623
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:01,495
You can call me a sinner
For a-wondering why 

624
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,832
Hey darlin'
Sleeping on the blacktop 

625
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,876
Hey darlin'
Running through the trees, honey 

626
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,170
Hey darlin'
Leaving for the next town 

627
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,715
Less'n my sense catches up with me 

628
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,220
It's me.

629
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:19,722
Pakuna.

630
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,600
Rangers came. Took everything.

631
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,603
Then they found Abuelo.

632
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,190
How?

633
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,234
I don't know.
But they asked a lot of questions.

634
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,153
-What did you tell them?
-Nothing.

635
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:35,863
I swear.

636
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,366
I told you. I'm not like Abuelo.

637
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,619
I won't ever skim or screw you guys over.

638
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,121
At least not as long
as you get what you want, right?

639
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,502
I won't screw you over.

640
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,920
You said that.

641
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,340
Let's hope that you're right.

642
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,237
Let's have a chat, Pakuna.
