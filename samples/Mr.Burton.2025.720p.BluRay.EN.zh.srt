00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:26,042
哦。
Oh.

150
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:31,084
我们"，或许不是坏事，
就目前而言。
We", perhaps not a bad thing,
just at the moment.

151
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,476
我在想这是否对你有好处
I wonder if it wouldn't do you good

152
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,084
暂时把目光投向远方吧。
to look outward for a time.

153
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:40,268
你说得对，妈妈，你总是对的。
You are right, Ma, as you ever are.

154
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:43,334
毕竟现在是春天了。
It is spring, after all.

155
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:48,810
但我最想念的还是剧院。
Still it is the theatre that I miss.

156
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:49,893
嗯。
Hmm.

157
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:51,875
没有什么能替代它——没有。
There is nothing to replace it - No.

158
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:54,935
无论是广播还是电影都不行。
Not the wireless, not the cinema.

159
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,351
不行。
No.

160
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,935
我年轻时在基督教青年会经常参加戏剧演出。
We used to put on plays
when I was a girl at the YMCA.

161
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:03,834
噢，我太爱那个小舞台了。
Oh, I did love those It was
such a nice little stage.

162
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:08,875
妈，我在你这儿住了多久了？
Ma, how long
have I lodged here with you?

163
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:11,935
12年还是15年？
Twelve years, or 15?

164
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:15,851
你从没告诉过我你当过演员？
And you have never before
told me that you are an actress?

165
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,768
哦不，我...
Oh No, I

166
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,101
我演得肯定很糟糕
I'm quite sure I was terrible

167
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,393
快告诉我，你演过什么角色？
We", you must tell me, who did you play?

168
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:25,560
这个嘛...
Well, oh

169
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:28,101
我曾经演过朱丽叶。
Well, I did play Juliet once.

170
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:32,875
天啊！我居然错过了你的朱丽叶！
Ma! I curse the day
that I missed your Juliet!

171
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:34,917
哦，伯顿先生
Oh, Mr Burton

172
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,875
那匹马叫利布雷托，伙计。
Aye, anyway, Libretto,
the horse was called, man.

173
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,875
见鬼的是它居然赢了。
And damn me if he didn't bloody win.

174
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:14,226
你们可以随便评价赌博，小伙子们，
You can say what you like
about gambling, boys,

175
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,310
但我这辈子没见过比那更多的钱堆在一起。
but I haven't seen more money
in a single place to this day.

176
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,435
别提了 我父亲给全镇的人
Never mind a round My father
must have bought a drink

177
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:23,268
每人都买了一杯酒
for every man in Pontrhydyfen

178
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,143
所以到了打烊时分，
So, of course, come stop-tap,

179
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:30,351
就轮到我推着那个醉鬼爬坡回家...
it fell to me to wheel the
bugger back home up the hi...

180
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,060
那简直是场壮烈的攀登。
And an heroic climb it was,
I'm telling you.

181
00:15:33,084 --> 00:15:34,560
等我们到家门口时，
By the time we reached his gate,

182
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:36,310
我喘得像台蒸汽机。
I was blowing like a winding engine.

183
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:38,768
"千万别忘了轮椅刹车，孩子们"
"Never forget the brakes
on a wheelchair, boys"

184
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,125
嗯？
Huh?

185
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:48,709
哦。
Oh.

186
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:53,435
我们的小里奇
Our Richie

187
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,143

Jeanie, get a pint for the boy

188
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,351
我也再来一杯

189
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,476
现在继续讲，小家伙。
We" now, <i>bachan, bachan.</i>

190
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,417
我就喜欢这种打断方式。
That's the kind of interruption I like.

191
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:07,810
我说到哪儿了？对了。
Where was I, then? Aye.

192
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,084
千万别忘了轮椅刹车。
Never forget the brakes on a wheelchair.

193
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,851
这可是个教训啊
There's a lesson for you now

194
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,268
我停下来喘口气的功夫，
I stopped for a minute to catch my breath.

195
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:16,810
转眼间，
The next thing I know,

196
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,935
老爷子就顺着山坡冲下去了，
the old man was careering down the hi",

197
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,476
又喊又叫
shouting and screaming

198
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,393
还拍打着轮椅扶手，
and beating the side of his wheelchair,

199
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:26,518
"加油，利布雷托 加油"
"Come on, Libretto Come on"

200
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:28,393
"冲啊。"
"Come on."

201
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:31,167
他那速度啊，我永远都忘不了。
The speed he was going I tell
you, I shall never forget.

202
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:33,101
"加油，利布雷托。"
"Come on, Libretto."

203
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,351
沿着车站路往下走，经过丹伊邦特，
Down Station Road, past Dan-Y-Bont,

204
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,310
我最后一次听到他喊："利布雷托"。
and I heard him one last time, "Libretto".

205
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:39,542
然后砰的一声。
And whack.

206
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:44,709
老托马斯撞上了高架渠的桥墩。
Old Thomas met the pillar
of the aqueduct.

207
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:48,125
当场毙命

00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:57,042

如果你对戏剧感兴趣，
If you're interested in the theatre,

00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:42,393
我最近在基督教青年会
创办了个戏剧社团

随时欢迎你加入。

像在学校那样？

00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,435
但是，呃，我不想卖掉它们。
But, I, uh, I don't want to sell them.

307
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:14,250
要知道，这是我母亲
临终时给我的。
You see, my mother gave
them to me on her deathbed.

308
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:18,726

我想试试看。

詹金斯，我们正在读
剧本《主教的烛台》的片段，
So, Jenkins, we're reading
sections of our play,

316
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,667
<i>《主教的烛台》。</i>
<i>The Bishop's Candlesticks.</i>

317
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:51,476
要不你直接来试试？
And, uh, we", why don't you
jump right in?

318
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,893
我们需要有人演囚犯这个角色。
We need someone to play our Convict.

319
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:57,810
囚犯的戏从第九页开始，
对吧，贝纳姆？
Um, Convict begins on page nine,
is it, Baynham?

320
00:25:57,834 --> 00:26:00,060
是的，第九页最上面，先生。
Uh, yes, top of page nine, sir.

321
00:26:00,084 --> 00:26:04,601
听着詹金斯，
这个囚犯是个逃犯。
Now, Jenkins,
the Convict is a fugitive.

322
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:07,310
而且他饿坏了。
And he's starving.

323
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:10,101
他带着一把刀
And he is armed with a knife

324
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:12,459
闯进了主教的家里。
as he comes into the Bishop's house.

325
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:15,060
明白，先生。
Yes, sir.

326
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:17,601
别紧张，尽管试试看。
Don't worry Just just give it a go.

327
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:20,726
好，时钟敲响12下
Right The clock strikes 12

328
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,268
贝内特，你来当钟声。

00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:25,018
咚。

00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,351
- 再来点风声。

敢出声你就死定了！
If you call out, you are a dead man!

335
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:44,875
但是朋友，你看，我正在看书。
But, my friend, as you see, I am reading.

336
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:48,393
我为什么要喊人呢？
有什么能帮你的吗？
Why should I call out?
Can I help you in any way?

337
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:49,851
我要吃的 我快饿死了

我已经三天没吃东西了。
I haven't eaten anything in three days.

快给我吃的 快点 该死的

不错 第一次演就很像样
Good Very creditable First go.

341
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,935
我在想，
Um, I'm wondering.

342
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:01,125
如果他走投无路的话，呃
If he's desperate, uh

343
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:05,018
应该不想被人发现。
he doesn't want to be discovered.

344
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:08,792
或许我们可以试试，呃
Maybe we could try him, uh

345
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,310
更小声些？
Quieter?

346

小声点 好主意
Quieter Good idea

347
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:24,310
「敢出」声
你就死定了。
"If you ca" out,
you are a dead man.

348
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:26,000
好多了

Best be quick about it, mind.

351
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,393
我还要赶着去看戏呢。
Going to the theatre, I am, see.

352
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:06,060
我儿子在那演话剧
My boy's in a drama there

353
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,185
演戏是吧？
Acting, is it?

354
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:10,417
我手下有上千个孩子
Children in a thousand, I got

358
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:40,101
"那个..."演出结束后见
"And, uh, I'" see you after the show.

359
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:42,310
好的 祝你们一切顺利
Right And the very best of luck.

360
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:44,435
哦 我不该这么说的对吧？
Oh I'm not supposed to say that, am I?

361
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:54,500
我们只买了站票
We only paid for standing.

362
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:11,500
我爸今晚会来的 他答应过的
My father's coming tonight, he is.

363
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:16,334
别说了 吻我一下给我祝福吧
Don't say anything more Kiss
me and give me your blessing.

364
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:19,476
我去睡了
I'm going to bed

365
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,385
敢出声就要你的命！
If you call out,
you are a dead man!

366
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,042
- 台词？
- 我的朋友
- Line?
- My friend.

367
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:35,935
如你所见 我正在看书
My friend, as you see, I am reading.

368
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:39,000
我为什么要喊？
有什么能帮你的吗？
Why should I call out?
Can I help you in any way?

369
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,851
我要吃的 快饿死了
I want food I'm starving

00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,875
我已经三天没吃东西了
I haven't eaten anything in three days.

当然可以 孩子 你会有吃的
But, certainly,
my son, you shall have food

373

for the keys of the cupboard.

00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,584
坐下
Sit down.

我肚子里有头饿狼
I have a wolf inside me

376
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:09,000
在撕扯我的内脏
tearing at my entrails.

377
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:12,917
要把我撕碎
Tearing me apart

378
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,185
你演得太棒了 里奇 太棒了！
We thought you was wonderful,
Richie, wonderful!

379
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:31,834
还不算太糟对吧？
It weren't so bad, was it?

380
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,459
- 爸爸呢？
- 估计有事耽搁了
- Where's Daddy?
- Got held up, I expect.

381
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:39,060
好吧
Right.

382
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:40,750
詹金斯太太？
Mrs Jenkins?

383
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,935
詹姆斯太太 伯顿先生
Mrs James, Mr Burton.

384
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:46,435
这是我丈夫 埃尔菲德·詹姆斯
This is my husband, Mr Elfed James

385
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:48,935
我是里奇的姐姐
他现在和我们住
I'm Richie's sister
He lives with us, you see.

386
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:51,393
哦 - 您好
Oh - How do you do?

387
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:54,893
您好 您应该感到骄傲
How do you do? Well,
you should be very proud

388
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:57,935
理查德今晚表现非常出色
Richard excelled himself this evening

389
00:30:57,959 --> 00:31:00,101
只是遗憾他不再上学了
I'm only sorry he's no longer
attending school.

390
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:03,310
他特别喜欢您的课 伯顿先生
He did love your lessons, Mr Burton.

391
00:31:03,334 --> 00:31:05,310
整天挂在嘴边
Always on about them, he was.

392
00:31:05,334 --> 00:31:07,310
如果有什么我能帮忙的
Well, if there's anything I can do

393
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:09,560
理查德是个聪明的孩子
Richard is an intelligent boy.

394
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:12,500
比在商店打工强多了
He could do a lot better
than working in that shop.

395
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:21,875
我明白现在大家日子都不好过
I-I-I do understand these
are hard times for everyone,

396
00:31:22,042 --> 00:31:25,893
但或许可以让他重返校园
but it might be possible to have
him reinstated in school

397
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:31,893
我听到掌声了 太精彩了
I heard the applause Bloody marvelous

398
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:33,643
棒极了
Tremendous.

399
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,893
失陪了伯顿先生 再次感谢您
Please excuse me, Mr Burton
and thank you, again.

400
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:38,101
掌声雷动 震耳欲聋
Thunderous, it was A mighty roar

401
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,226
我在外面都听见了！
I could hear it out here!

402
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:47,709
加油。
Come on.

403
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:55,601
"现在大家日子都不好过"
"These are hard times
for everyone"

404
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,185
我明白他的意思。
I knew what he meant.

405
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:59,185
好像我没照顾支持过那孩子似的
Like I've not done and supported that boy

406
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,393
从他两岁起我就一直在帮他。
since he was two years old.

407
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:02,185
他愿意再给里奇一次机会。
He's willing to give Richie
another chance.

408
00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:04,768
那小子机会多得都要从眼眶里溢出来了
The boy's had chances
up to his eyeballs, man

409
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,060
我是说，那我们呢？
I mean, what about us?

410
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:07,726
那些一直扶持他的人怎么办？
What about those who has to carry him?

411
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,101
他是个重要人物
He's an important man

412
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:11,018
管那种人叫男人？
Call that sort a man, do you?

413
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:12,101
埃尔菲德。
Elfed.

414
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:15,393
好吧 给我个帮他的正当理由。
All right Give me one good
reason why I should help him.

415
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:17,310
他什么时候帮过我？帮过你？
When has he ever helped me? Or you?

416
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:20,060
因为这个家从没有人完成过学业。
Cos no one in this family has
ever finished their education.

417
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:21,792
一个都没有，从来没有。
Not one of us, never.

418
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:27,417
埃尔菲德。
Elfed.

419
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:31,685
就再多一年 甚至不到，十个月。
It's one more year
Not even that, ten months.

420
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:34,334
到时候他就会被征召入伍，不管愿不愿意。
Then he' " be ca" ed up to
the forces, like it or not.

421
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,292
"你"再也不用资助他了。
"You'" never have to support him again.

422
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,500
那小子得自食其力。
The boy has to pay his way.

423
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:46,643
要是我自费去上学呢？
What if I paid my way
and went to school?

424
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:48,518
眼见为实
I'd believe that when I saw it

425
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:50,250
我能做到的，真的可以，不骗你。
I could do it, I could, honest.

426
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,625
我受够合作社了，明白吗？
I can't stand the Co-op no more, see? I

427
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:58,084
我什么都愿意做，我保证。
I'll do anything, I will I promise.

428
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:04,250
那就证明给我看。
Then prove it.

429
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:11,792
那就再见啦
Ta-ra then

430
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,268
干得好，你
Good work, you

431
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,393
明天见
See you tomorrow

432
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:41,060
我认为詹金斯有充分理由申请重新评估
I think Jenkins has
a strong case for reassessment

433
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:45,226
我相信他展现出相当的智力潜力。
I believe he shows considerable
intellectual promise.

434
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,875
复学许可非常罕见。
It's very unusual that
a reinstatement will be awarded.

435
00:33:49,042 --> 00:33:53,875
但我们的职责是评估孩子潜力，
But it is our job
to assess a child's potential,

436
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:56,185
而非用过去评判他。
not judge him by his past.

437
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:58,185
没有旧报纸要卖给我们吧？
Haven't got any old papers
for us, have you?

438
00:33:58,209 --> 00:33:59,750
让我看看。
Let me have a look, now.

00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:02,209
找到了
Here we are

440
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:10,435
六十三份报纸，比上周多两份。
Sixty-three papers I got for
you, Edith Two up on last week.

441
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:11,893
那你想要多少钱？
How much do you want for them, then?

442
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,167
一先令？
Shilling?

443
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:22,875
詹金斯告诉我他的长期志向
Jenkins has told me that
it is his ambition, long held,

444
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:25,018
是成为一名教师。
to become a teacher himself.

445
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:28,542
回馈养育他的社区。
To give back to the community
that has supported him.

446
00:34:29,459 --> 00:34:33,018
<i>我相信詹金斯完成学业后</i>
<i>I believe that what Jenkins will gain</i>

447
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:37,893
所获得的将千百倍回馈，
from completing his education
will be repaid many times over,

448
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:41,060
造福这座城镇世世代代。
to the benefit of this town
for generations to come.

449
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:49,709
请在外面稍候，我们要进行表决。
If you'd like to wait outside,
we can make a decision.

450
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:53,834
谢谢
Thank you

451
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:10,018
早上好，伯顿先生。

还有，呃，欢迎回来，詹金斯。
And, uh, welcome back, Jenkins.

454
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:19,125
长官

00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:46,875
我...我...我是值火警的詹金斯。

你在读什么？
What are you reading?

458
00:35:57,709 --> 00:36:00,042
詹姆斯·乔伊斯的作品，长官——哦，是吗？
James Joyce, it is, sir - Oh, yes?

459
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,601
啊。
Ah.

460
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:08,643
这可不是爱尔兰教育体系的最佳广告。
Not the best advertisement for
the Irish educational system.

461
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,875
我想找个机会
I wanted the chance to

462
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,917
好好感谢您，真的
多亏您让我重返校园。
well, thank you properly, I did
For getting me back into school.

463
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:30,000
"只要通过考试
这就是"我想要的感谢。
"Just pass your exams
That's a" the thanks I ask.

464
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:37,935
如果说灯火管制有什么好处，
If there is one thing to be said
for the blackout,

465
00:36:37,959 --> 00:36:39,625
那就是天空变得格外清澈。
it's the clarity of the skies.

466
00:36:41,084 --> 00:36:45,000
看，看到正在西沉的火星了吗？
Look See Mars setting?

467
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:49,417
- 那里有红色闪光？
- 是的。
- There's a flicker of red?
- Yeah.

468
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,042
你知道吗。
You know.

469
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:58,351
我曾经在莫哈韦沙漠的星空下度过一夜。
I once spent a night under
the stars in the Mojave Desert.

470
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:01,000
莫哈韦沙漠？在加利福尼亚？
The Mojave Desert? In California?

471
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:06,542
你去过洛杉矶吗？
Have you been to Los Angeles?

472
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:09,375
见过什么名人吗？
Did you meet anyone famous?

473
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:15,125
嗯，事实上确实见过 呃...
Well, as a matter of fact, I did Um.

474
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,726
埃迪·坎托
Eddie Cantor

475
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,685
多萝西·拉莫尔 —— 多萝西·拉莫尔？
Dorothy Lamour - Dorothy Lamour?

476
00:37:20,709 --> 00:37:24,351
我们其实变得相当熟络
We actually became quite friendly

477
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:28,768
我当时在进行戏剧交流
为期六个月的学术休假。
I was on a theatrical exchange
Six months' sabbatical.

478
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:30,000
伯顿先生？
Mr Burton?

479
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,334
什么事，詹金斯？
Yes, Jenkins?

480
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:37,101
有件事
我想请教您。
There is something
I wanted to ask you.

481
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:40,584
或者说...告诉您，真的，我想。
Or-or you know, tell
you, really, I suppose.

482
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:44,417
- 哦，是吗？
- 我在考虑，您看
- Oh, yes?
- I was thinking, see

483
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:46,667
或许我
that I might

484
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:49,792
想当一名演员。
want to be an actor.

485
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:56,060
你想当演员？
You would like to be an actor?

486
00:37:56,084 --> 00:37:59,435
我知道这不常见，
但我在想，您知道的，
I know it's not usual,
but I wondered if, you know,

487
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:01,125
您是否认为我能行。
if you thought that I could.

488
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:09,226
我能做到的，长官 我确信我能。
I could do it, sir I know I could.

489
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,685
- 如果您愿意帮助我。
- 如果我要帮助你的话<i>（语法纠正）</i>。
- If you was to help me.
- If I <i>were</i> to help you.

490
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,810
是的是的，长官 您明白吗？
Yes Yes, yes, sir You know?

491
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,601
如果...如果您能帮助我
If If you were to help me

492
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:21,417
我并非有意刻薄，詹金斯，但
I don't mean to be unkind, Jenkins, but

493
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:24,351
今天实在太漫长了。
it's been a long day.

494
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:30,435
"现在我只想"
凝望星空
"And a" I want for now
is to wonder at the stars

495
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:34,792
并且希望没人
朝我们扔燃烧弹
and for no one to drop
an incendiary on us

496
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:15,601
- 谢谢您，长官。
- 谢谢您，伯顿先生。
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, Mr Burton.

497
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:19,084
谢谢长官 - 谢谢长官。
Thank you, sir - Thank you, sir.

498
00:39:21,334 --> 00:39:23,042
詹金斯，有空吗？
Jenkins, have you got a moment?

499
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,042
今天下午方便吗？
Are you free this afternoon?

500
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:33,875
可以安排，长官。
I can be, sir.

501
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:42,209
那好，詹金斯 跟我来。
Right then, Jenkins Follow me.

502
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,768
长官，我们接下来要去哪儿？
Where are we gonna go then, sir?

503
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:48,375
是"去"不是"去儿"
"Go" not "gor."

504
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,167
"去" 去 去 - 往那边
"Go" Go Go - Up there.

505
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,018
别往孤零零的洞里
Don't throw stones

506
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:58,334
乱扔石头，谁知道会砸到哪儿
into lonely holes without
knowing where they're going.

507
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,685
给我念念那块牌子
Read that sign for me.

508
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:07,209
"请随手关门"
"Please close the gate."

509
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:11,084
"门"不是"门儿"
"Gate" not "gairt."

510
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:13,893
门
Gate.

511
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:15,875
"请随手关门"
"Please close the gate."

512
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:18,375
"请随手关门"
"Please close the gate."

513
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,393
注意听元音发音
Listen to the vowel sounds.

514
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:26,101
演员必须懂得如何展现台词的价值
An actor must know how
to extract their fu" value

515
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:29,792
"请随手关门"
"Please close the gate".

516
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:34,500
"请随手关门"
"Please close the gate."

517
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:38,000
现在
Now.

518
00:40:39,334 --> 00:40:41,518
请随手关门
Please close the gate.

519
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:43,417
嗯？哦
Huh? Oh.

520
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,667
音高 发音 重音
Pitch Pronunciation Emphasis.

521
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:52,375
这些都是你必须掌握的技巧
These are the skills
you must learn to employ.

522
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:57,310
长官，咱们就在这儿聊吗？
Are we gonna talk by 'ere
then, sir, are we?

523
00:40:57,334 --> 00:40:59,500
去 去
Going Go-ing.

524
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,560
还有 詹金斯 要说"这里"
And, please, Jenkins, the word is "here",

525
00:41:03,584 --> 00:41:05,476
不是"这儿"
not "by 'ere".

526
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,792
"这儿"
- 缩短元音 "这里"
"H'yere"
- Shorten the vowel "Here".

527
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:10,726
这儿
H'yere.

528
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,685
送气音
Aspirate.

529
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:16,726
听说希瑟·霍德正在酒店里
Have you heard Heather Hodder
is here at the hotel

530
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,375
歇斯底里地发疯？这里
happily having hysterics? Here.

531
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,250
这里
Here.

532
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:26,893
回答你的问题 是的 我们就在这儿
And, in answer to your question,
yes, we are

533
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,726
我觉得史密斯夫人现在
I don't think Mrs Smith
would appreciate our company

534
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,643
应该不想见到我们
under the circumstances.

535
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:34,584
现在开始《亨利五世》
Now then <i>Henry V.</i>

536
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:38,435
先从开场白开始
Let us start with the Chorus speech,

537
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:42,101
这段你应该很熟悉了
with which, of course, you are familiar.

538
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:47,601
这段开场白就像是咒语
The Chorus is an incantation, as it were.

539
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:50,476
你的任务就是传达
Your task is simply
to deliver the meaning

540
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,476
这种特殊表达形式
of what is, after all,

541
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:59,084
伊丽莎白时期无韵诗的含义
an unusual form of speech,
Elizabethan blank verse.

542
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:01,292
开始吧
Let's hear it.

543
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,518
啊！愿有一支火神的诗笔
O for a Muse of fire,

544
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:07,935
引领我们直上九霄创新的天庭
that would ascend the brightest
heaven of invention.

545
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,042
停
Stop.

546
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:15,459
简直糟糕透顶
That is mostly dreadful.

547
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:20,476
重来 站稳 双脚抓地
Right Stand firm Plant your feet.

548
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,750
挺胸 抬头
Shoulders back Head erect.

549
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:27,935
好
Good.

550
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:29,875
再来一次
Let's give it another try.

551
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:33,584
能听清我说话吗？
Are you able to hear me?

552
00:42:34,542 --> 00:42:35,601
是的。
Yes.

553
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:37,851
啊，愿我有一团烈火的诗神
O for a Muse of fire

554
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:41,685
能登上那最辉煌的天堂。
that would ascend the brightest
heaven of invention.

555
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:43,459
你能听到吗？
Are you able to hear that?

556
00:42:44,917 --> 00:42:46,459
能。
Yes.

557
00:42:47,709 --> 00:42:51,375
好，现在你来试试
Good Now you have a try

558
00:42:53,334 --> 00:42:55,393
啊，愿我有一团烈火的诗神
能登上。
O for a Muse of fire
that would ascend.

559
00:42:55,417 --> 00:42:56,834
停。
Stop.

560
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:58,875
我刚才在大喊大叫吗？
Was I shouting?

561
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:01,268
没有。
No.

562
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:05,518
音量，詹金斯，
是次要的。
Volume, Jenkins,
is of secondary importance.

563
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:09,084
清晰度，这才是你必须掌握的。
Distinctness, this is what you must learn.

564
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:15,643
现在，我要你尽可能大声地尖叫。
Now, I would like you to scream,
as loud as you can.

565
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:17,060
尖叫？
Scream?

566
00:43:17,084 --> 00:43:18,125
尖叫
Scream

567
00:43:28,584 --> 00:43:30,000
再来一次
And again

568
00:43:37,667 --> 00:43:42,185
尖叫和喊叫一样，
Screaming, as with shouting,

569
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:47,060
就是尽可能从肺部排出更多空气，
is simply moving as much air
out of your lungs as you can,

570
00:43:47,084 --> 00:43:50,893
并绷紧声带发出声音。
and straining your vocal cords
to make a sound.

571
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:56,726
而投射力，要充满整个剧场，
Projection, on the other hand,
filling a theatre,

572
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,209
这需要运用横膈膜的肌肉，
that is a matter of using
the muscle in your diaphragm,

573
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,268
这里，还有你的肺部，这里，
here, and your lungs, here,

574
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:09,601
这样你才能控制气流，保持清晰，
so that you can control
the flow of air, retain clarity,

575
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:13,143
并显著提高音量。
and make a significant
increase in volume.

576
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:17,060
因此，你的任务是区分
Your task, therefore, is to distinguish

577
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:20,351
这两者的不同。
between these two things.

578
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:25,393
所以，必要时就在这里待到天黑，
So, stay here until nightfall if necessary,

579
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:27,459
我们明早见。
and I will see you in the morning.

580
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:30,459
我想这是第一课。
First lesson, I believe.

581
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:35,143
你要把我一个人留在这儿吗？就这儿。
Are you leaving me h'yere? Here.

582
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:37,560
不停地尖叫
Scream and scream

583
00:44:37,584 --> 00:44:40,726
直到找到不伤嗓子的方法
until you can find a way for it not to hurt

584
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:44,667
我知道这听起来很原始，
但会很有效。
I know it sounds primitive,
but it will be effective.

585
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,042
尖叫
Scream

586
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:55,000
再大声点
Louder

587
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:10,643
"所有东西"都在上面，是吗？
"Everything a" right up there, is it?

588
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,018
是的，谢谢。
Yes, thank you.

589
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:20,185
嘶...嘘...呼...
Sss Shh Fff.

590
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:21,476
嘛...
Mah

591
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,393
詹金斯，这位是我的房东史密斯太太。
Jenkins Mrs Smith, my landlady.

592
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:25,476
您好。
How do you do?

593
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,768
詹金斯想成为一名演员。
Jenkins feels that
he would like to be an actor.

594
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,334
哦，是这样吗？
Oh, is that a fact?

595
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,893
你的声音沙哑、失控
Your voice is raspy, uncontrolled

596
00:45:43,917 --> 00:45:47,185
而且完全缺乏音域变化。
and completely lacking in range.

597
00:45:47,209 --> 00:45:50,709
"事实上，我们可能"在浪费时间。
"Indeed, we may we" be wasting our time.

598
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:52,893
<i>啊，愿我有一团烈火的诗神</i>
<i>O for a Muse of fire</i>

599
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,685
<i>能登上那最辉煌的天堂。</i>
<i>that would ascend the brightest
heaven of invention.</i>

600
00:45:55,709 --> 00:45:57,643
<i>愿我的王国成为舞台，王子们来表演，</i>
<i>My kingdom for a stage, princes to act,</i>

601
00:45:57,667 --> 00:45:59,810
<i>君主们来观赏这壮丽的场景</i>
<i>and monarchs to behold
the swelling scene</i>

602
00:45:59,834 --> 00:46:02,143
<i>天呐，这嗓音。</i>
<i>Dear me, that voice.</i>

603
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:05,560
这嗓音值得好好培养
他长得也很端正。
A voice you can work on
He has a good face.

604
00:46:05,584 --> 00:46:08,893
端正的面容，还有猫一般的眼睛。
A good face, and eyes like a cat.

605
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:11,875
<i>如果你想成为专业演员</i>
<i>If you want to be
a professional actor,</i>

606
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:15,125
绝不能仅靠他人鼓励
it must be
not because of encouragement

607
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:18,060
而是要克服重重阻碍。
but in spite of discouragement.

608
00:46:18,084 --> 00:46:21,101
你很有潜力。
You have promise.

609
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:25,435
但若缺乏训练
潜力永远只是潜力。
But without discipline,
promise will remain unfulfilled"ed.

610
00:46:25,459 --> 00:46:31,018
有位老演员曾告诉我
没背完《诗篇》第一章六节经文
An old actor once told me that
nobody can play Shakespeare

611
00:46:31,042 --> 00:46:36,310
就演不了莎士比亚
until he can recite all
six verses of the First Psalm

612
00:46:36,334 --> 00:46:37,834
必须一口气背完。
in a single breath.

613
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:40,643
"不从恶人的计谋
不站罪人的道路
"Blessed is the man that walketh
not in the counsel

614
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:42,226
不坐亵慢人的座位
惟喜爱耶和华的律法
of the ungodly, nor standeth
in the way of sinners,

615
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,601
昼夜思想
nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful,

616
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:44,810
这人便为有福
but his delight is in the law of the Lord,

617
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:46,185
他要像一棵树
栽在溪水旁
and in His law
doth he meditate day and night,

618
00:46:46,209 --> 00:46:47,935
按时候结果子
and he shall be like a tree
planted by the rivers of water,

619
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:49,268
叶子也不枯干
that bringeth forth his fruit in his season;

620
00:46:49,292 --> 00:46:50,351
凡他所做的尽都顺利"
his leaf also shall not wither;

621
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:53,167
你之前知道这个吗？
and whatsoever he doeth
shall prosper ""

622
00:46:55,542 --> 00:46:58,709
英文版的我没听过
Did you know that already?

623
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:02,875
那曾是火焰般的诗神啊
Not in English, I didn't

624
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,042
"雨点噼里啪啦落下
O for a Muse of fire that was.

625
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:30,893
滴滴答答淅淅沥沥"
"The rain comes pittering pattering down,

626
00:47:30,917 --> 00:47:33,185
"农夫赶马进城去
plippetty, plippetty plop".

627
00:47:33,209 --> 00:47:34,768
"嘚嘚嘚马蹄疾"
-理查德
"The farmer drives his horse to town,

628
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:37,101
"雨声淅沥马蹄急

629
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:39,143
- "嘚嘚嘚马蹄疾"
-理查德！看在上帝份上！
"The rain comes pattering,
horse goes clattering,

630
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:42,917
你看不出老师在教什么吗？
- "clippetty, clippetty clop"
- Richard! For God sakes, boy!

631
00:47:44,709 --> 00:47:48,000
你这种粗人根本不懂
Don't you see what this teacher is doing?

632
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:52,310
你就是个榆木脑袋
We", you wouldn't understand,
would you?

633
00:47:52,334 --> 00:47:54,250
理查
You're an intellectual brute.

634
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,042
你
Richie.

635
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,292
这样说话
You

636
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:06,292
不只是在对我说
talking like that, you

637
00:48:08,042 --> 00:48:10,875
你是在羞辱我们全家
you're not just talking to me, you know.

638
00:48:11,042 --> 00:48:12,810
你姐姐、你父亲、你母亲
"You're talking it at a" of us.

639
00:48:12,834 --> 00:48:17,334
所有养育你的人
Your sister, your father, your mother.

640
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:21,018
听着
Everybody you come from

641
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:28,709
我威尔士语是不太行
Look, I.

642
00:48:30,959 --> 00:48:35,042
但我很清楚自己是谁
I'm not so good at the Welsh, I know that.

643
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:38,375
你的嗓音是天赐的礼物
But I know who I am.

644
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:44,542
<i>你的</i>嗓音
Now, your voice,
that's your birthright, it is.

645
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:47,584
<i>噢，我感觉好奇怪</i>
<i>Your</i> voice

646
00:48:51,709 --> 00:48:54,667
<i>你在香槟里加了什么？</i>
<i>Oh, I do feel so queer.</i>

647
00:48:56,084 --> 00:48:58,000
<i>是啊 那些气泡</i>
<i>Did you put something funny
in the champagne?</i>

648
00:48:58,584 --> 00:49:00,226
<i>花了我好几个小时
每个气泡都是亲手注入</i>
<i>Yes The bubbles</i>

649
00:49:01,334 --> 00:49:05,643
<i>动作特别轻柔</i>
<i>It took me hours Every single
little bubble put in by hand,</i>

650
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:06,750
<i>不该给我点奖励吗？</i>
<i>rather gently.</i>

651
00:49:08,167 --> 00:49:10,935
[翻译结果缺失]
<i>Don't you think I deserve
just a little reward for that?</i>

652
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:12,000
<i>哦，不</i>
<i>Oh, no</i>

653
00:49:13,459 --> 00:49:16,101
<i>得不到那个吻
我就坐在这儿不走了</i>
<i>I'm not going to budge
from here until I get that kiss</i>

654
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:18,084
<i>而且我坐得可舒服了</i>
<i>and I'm sitting very comfortably</i>

655
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:22,560
<i>你赢了赌注？就你？</i>
<i>You won my bet? You?</i>

656
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:25,768
狂妄的小子！明明是我赢了
Presumptuous insect! I won it.

657
00:49:25,792 --> 00:49:27,685
你朝我扔拖鞋是什么意思？
What did you throw those
slippers at me for?

658
00:49:27,709 --> 00:49:29,726
因为我想砸烂你的脸
Because I wanted to smash your face

659
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,000
我真想宰了你，你这个自私的畜生
I'd like to ki" you, you selfish brute.

660
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:36,000
这家伙紧张得很呢
The creature is nervous, after a".

661
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:40,893
哦？是吗？收起你的爪子，野猫
Ah Would you? Claws in, you cat.

662
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:42,935
你竟敢冲我发脾气？
How dare you show your temper to me?

663
00:49:42,959 --> 00:49:44,435
我该怎么办？
What's to become of me?

664
00:49:55,042 --> 00:49:56,209
头往后仰
Head back.

665
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:04,584
疼吗？
That hurt?

666
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:07,459
不疼
No.

667
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:11,792
不，一点都不疼
No, no, doesn't 'urt.

668
00:50:13,042 --> 00:50:16,000
「疼」字要送气发音
"Hurt" Aspirate.

669
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:25,084
理查德，到底怎么回事？
What on earth is the matter, Richard?

670
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:27,625
演出搞砸了
The show went we".

671
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:31,459
是啊搞砸了，现在我要回
卡拉多克街了
Yeah, we", now I go back
to Caradoc Street.

672
00:50:33,584 --> 00:50:36,417
那有什么问题吗？
There What is wrong with that?

673
00:50:39,209 --> 00:50:40,851
那儿没人待见我
I'm not much wanted there.

674
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:43,351
哦，我可不这么认为
Oh, I hardly believe that.

675
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:46,268
你姐姐可疼你了
Your sister dotes on you.

676
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:47,601
问题是埃尔菲德
It's Elfed that's the problem.

677
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:49,810
他恨我 他在打压我
He hates me He's crushing me.

678
00:50:49,834 --> 00:50:51,810
说真的，伯顿先生
我实在受不了了
Honestly, Mr Burton,
I can't stand it anymore

679
00:50:51,834 --> 00:50:53,518
我都不知道该怎么办
I don't know what I'm going to do.

680
00:50:53,542 --> 00:50:55,560
我父亲家里没我住的地方
There's no space in my father's house.

681
00:50:55,584 --> 00:50:56,917
好了
There we are.

682
00:50:58,625 --> 00:51:01,435
明晚应该能派上用场
That should be serviceable
for tomorrow night.

683
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:04,060
要是有空房
我就租一间
I'd rent a room,
if I could find one.

684
00:51:04,084 --> 00:51:06,750
对了，史密斯太太
正好有间空房
We", of course,
Mrs Smith has a vacant room.

685
00:51:09,292 --> 00:51:12,601
- 我可以搬去和你住！
- 嗯？
- I can move in with you!
- Hmm?

686
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:15,851
我很确定埃尔菲德
尤其是你姐姐
I'm quite sure Elfed
and especially your sister

687
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:18,875
- 不会同意的
- 能帮我问问她吗，伯顿先生？
- wouldn't want you to.
- Could you ask her, Mr Burton?

688
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:20,893
帮我问问？就问问她
For me? Could you? Just ask her.

689
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:24,584
天啊，不行
我不该提这事的
Dear me, no I
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

690
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:32,000
你看吧？
You see?

691
00:51:33,834 --> 00:51:35,584
关键时刻
When push comes to shove

692
00:51:37,084 --> 00:51:38,709
根本没人要我
nobody wants me.

693
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:43,584
我很遗憾，理查德
I'm sorry, Richard.

694
00:51:45,417 --> 00:51:49,018
<i>我必须承认
我确实有所顾虑</i>
<i>I cannot pretend that
I don't have my misgivings</i>

695
00:51:49,042 --> 00:51:51,560
我从没招过这个年纪的房客
I've never had a lodger of such an age,

696
00:51:51,584 --> 00:51:54,167
而且他哪付得起
每周五先令的租金？
and how can he afford
five shillings a week?

697
00:51:56,584 --> 00:52:00,167
但我...我还有其他顾虑
But, I-I-I do have other concerns.

698
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:05,875
你知道的，教年轻男孩是一回事
As you know, teaching a young
man here, that is one thing.

699
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:08,875
但让他住进家里？
But having him living in the house?

700
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:12,375
这肯定会
It's bound to fuel

701
00:52:14,459 --> 00:52:16,000
惹人闲话
speculation.

702
00:52:19,209 --> 00:52:24,000
妈，您真的不用为我担心
We", you do not need to worry
about <i>me,</i> Ma.

703
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:29,042
可我就是放心不下，伯顿先生
"Yes, but I <i>do</i> worry,
a" the same, Mr Burton.

704
00:52:30,292 --> 00:52:34,435
况且这事可能只是纸上谈兵
Besides, this may be quite academic.

705
00:52:34,459 --> 00:52:37,459
他姐姐和姐夫很可能不会同意
His sister and brother-in-law
may well not agree.

706
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:16,125
谢谢您，詹姆斯先生
Thank you, Mr James.

707
00:53:18,834 --> 00:53:20,000
请讲
Please.

708
00:53:21,292 --> 00:53:24,000
- 下午好 詹姆斯太太
- 您好 伯顿先生
- Good afternoon, Mrs James.
- He"o, Mr Burton.

709
00:53:27,292 --> 00:53:30,167
- 需要帮您挂外套吗
- 外套
- Shall I take that for you?
- Coat.

710
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:34,185
如您所知 理查德向我提出
<i>As you know,
Richard has asked me</i>

711
00:53:34,209 --> 00:53:38,476
想从这儿搬几条街的距离
if he might move
the few streets from here

712
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:43,143
住到我现在租住的史密斯夫人家
to Mrs Smith's house,
where I currently reside.

713
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:44,792
但是
But

714
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:48,893
我必须立刻表明立场
I should say at once, however,

715
00:53:48,917 --> 00:53:51,060
我认为有诸多原因
I think there are a number of reasons

716
00:53:51,084 --> 00:53:54,084
表明这可能不是个好主意
why this might <i>not</i> be a good idea.

717
00:53:57,584 --> 00:54:00,625
可这明明是您的主意 孩子亲口告诉我的
But it was your idea, the boy did tell me.

718
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,417
确实 那个...
It is true, that, uh

719
00:54:05,584 --> 00:54:10,459
我无意间提到有空房间的事
unthinkingly, I
I did mention a vacant room.

720
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:13,500
所以您不愿收留他？
So you won't take him on?

721
00:54:15,209 --> 00:54:19,875
我绝非对理查德缺乏责任感
I do not wish to imply any lack
of commitment to Richard.

722
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:23,601
您知道 我为他投入了大量时间
As you know, I have
dedicated a lot of time to him.

723
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:26,351
帮他加入空军学员队
Enlisting him in the RAF Cadet Force,

724
00:54:26,375 --> 00:54:28,726
辅导功课
and helping him with his schoolwork

725
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,185
还有表演技艺
and craft of acting.

726
00:54:31,209 --> 00:54:34,476
事实上他在各方面
And, indeed, he has been made
remarkable progress

727
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,935
都取得了显著进步
in all these areas.

728
00:54:36,959 --> 00:54:39,292
甚至可以考虑上大学
We might even consider university.

729
00:54:40,625 --> 00:54:42,125
上大学？
University?

730
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:48,250
但搬离原生家庭...
But to move out of the family home is.

731
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:51,667
这可是重大决定
Well, it's a considerable step.

732
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,351
他够成熟吗？
Is he old enough?

733
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:57,935
他有这个责任心吗？
Is he responsible enough?

734
00:54:57,959 --> 00:54:59,334
那您愿意承担他的房租？
So you would pay his rent?

735
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:07,226
经过深思熟虑 我愿意承担
After long consideration,
I would be prepared to meet.

736
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:10,500
那您就该收下他 伯顿先生
Then I think you should
take him on, Mr Burton.

737
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:13,709
请说
Please.

738
00:55:14,792 --> 00:55:16,000
收下他吧
Take him on.

739
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,042
理查德在哪？
Where is Richard?

740
00:55:24,959 --> 00:55:26,875
在楼上呢
Upstairs, he is.

741
00:55:27,042 --> 00:55:32,500
或许我们该当面一起商量
Perhaps we should discuss this
together in the same room.

742
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,084
那我去叫他下来
"Well, I'" go fetch him, then.

743
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:50,042
詹姆斯太太
Mrs James

744
00:55:51,292 --> 00:55:56,000
理查德首先是您儿子
其次才是您弟弟
Richard is your son much more
than he is your brother.

745
00:55:57,209 --> 00:55:59,584
我明白你们感情有多深
I know how much you love each other.

746
00:56:00,584 --> 00:56:05,542
请告诉我 您希望我怎么做？
Please, tell me, what is it
you want me to do?

747
00:56:07,709 --> 00:56:09,667
若您肯收留他 伯顿先生
If you take him, Mr Burton,

748
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:13,334
这将是天赐的恩典
"it'" be the answer to my prayers

749
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,851
有人吗？
Hello?

750
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:04,768
八点整 理查德
妈妈最讨厌我们迟到
Eight o'clock, Richard
Ma likes us to be prompt.

751
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:06,417
知道了
A" right.

752
00:57:24,334 --> 00:57:26,310
理查德，或许你可以在早餐后整理一下卧室。
Perhaps you could tidy your bedroom

753
00:57:26,334 --> 00:57:27,935
早餐后，理查德。
after breakfast, Richard.

754
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:31,560
或许——或——许。
P'rhaps - Per-haps.

755
00:57:31,584 --> 00:57:33,351
或——许。
Per-haps.

756
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:34,834
- 够了吗？
- 嗯。
- Enough?
- Hmm.

757
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:53,125
早上好——早，妈妈。
Good morning - Morning, Ma.

758
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:56,209
- 睡得怎么样？
- 像个无辜的孩子。
- How did you sleep?
- Like an innocent.

759
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,935
不，不，抱歉，理查德，
Right No, no, I'm sorry, Richie,

760
00:57:59,959 --> 00:58:03,060
但这在这里真的行不通。
but that that really will not do here.

761
00:58:03,084 --> 00:58:04,750
不。
Right No.

762
00:58:06,042 --> 00:58:09,625
把边缘朝向你，明白吗？
Use the edge towards you Right?

763
00:58:10,459 --> 00:58:13,351
不，不，不，不，不，不，不
No, no, no, no No, no, no

764
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:16,476
拿过来，拿到嘴边。
Bring it Bring it to your mouth.

765
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,167
明白吗？天哪。
Right? Dear me.

766
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:21,685
好吧！
Well!

767
00:58:21,709 --> 00:58:23,268
对——这样好多了。
Right - That's better.

768
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:26,042

"And whatever you do, don't
speak with your mouth fu"

00:58:27,709 --> 00:58:29,435
哦，看在老天的份上
Oh, for goodness' sake

770
00:58:29,459 --> 00:58:30,917
我就觉得闻到什么了！
I thought I could smell something!

771
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:35,685
可我只有这两双袜子，妈妈。
Well, I only have
the two pairs, Ma.

772
00:58:35,709 --> 00:58:37,893
老实说，这袜子洞比袜子还多
Right Well, honestly,
there's more hole than sock

773
00:58:39,209 --> 00:58:40,667
你母亲从没想过吗。
Did your mother never think.

774
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:49,542
"这是个"，好吧，妈妈。
"It's a" right, Ma.

775
00:58:52,167 --> 00:58:55,917
我当时才两岁，对她一点印象都没有。
I was only two I don't remember
anything about her.

776
00:59:02,084 --> 00:59:05,459
幸好有我和伯顿先生在这里。
We", it's a good job I'm here
Myself and Mr Burton.

777
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:09,185
好了，吃完早餐，
Right We", finish your breakfast,

778
00:59:09,209 --> 00:59:10,685
然后把它们脱下来，
and then take them off,

779
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:12,500
"我会"看看能不能找双干净的。
"and I'" if I can't find some fresh ones.

780
00:59:17,209 --> 00:59:19,435
- 那是什么？
- 嗯？
- What's that?
- Hmm?

781
00:59:19,459 --> 00:59:21,917
哦，没什么
Oh Nothing

782
00:59:36,084 --> 00:59:38,750
怎么了？
Yes?

783
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:44,084
你一个人住不会觉得孤单吗？
Do you never
get lonely, living on your own?

784
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:48,209
有修养的人永远不会孤单。
A cultured person is never lonely.

太美了——不是吗？
That's wonderful - Isn't it, though?

791
01:00:16,459 --> 01:00:17,792
天知道这是什么意思。
God knows what it means.

792
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:21,875
你在哪儿找到的？
Where'd you find it?

793
01:00:23,042 --> 01:00:25,893
我有PH的图书馆，不是吗？
Well, I've got PH's library, don't I?

794
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:28,000
我甚至还有他的袜子
I even have his socks

795
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,875
你知道吗，理查德。
You know, Richie.

796
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:36,682
你和我预想的完全不一样。
You're not a bit like I thought you'd be.

797
01:00:39,709 --> 01:00:40,750
怎么说？
How so?

798
01:00:43,542 --> 01:00:46,542
"我以为你会更，呃"
"I thought you'd be more, we"

799
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,726
毛手毛脚

800
01:00:50,584 --> 01:00:54,000
你懂我的意思。
You know what I mean.

801
01:00:56,584 --> 01:01:00,417
而你从不对我那样。
And you never not with me.

802
01:01:02,042 --> 01:01:04,709
是啊，我们说"我们"，
因为我是个绅士。
Yeah, we", that's because
I'm a gentleman.

803
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:16,875
其实你也想这么做，对吧？
You do want to though, don't you?

804
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,792
我当然他妈想啊。
Of course I bloody want to.

805
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,167
很好。
Good.

806
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:33,542
你怎么会觉得我不想呢？
Why on earth would you think I don't?

807
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:38,625
不知道，当我没说
I dunno It's nothing

808
01:01:49,417 --> 01:01:50,667
理查德？
Richard?

809
01:01:59,042 --> 01:02:03,393
我希望你重考
数学试卷。
I would like you to repeat
your mathematics paper.

810
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:04,834
我的数学？
My mathematics?

811
01:02:06,334 --> 01:02:07,851
可是PH老师，您说过我考得不错。
But, PH, you said it was good.

812
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:09,709
是不错，但是呢
Good, yes, but, uh

813
01:02:11,042 --> 01:02:13,250
不错还不够好
good is not good enough

814
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:20,101
可我想当演员，
不是教授啊
But I want to be
an actor, not a professor

815
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:21,601
理查德。
Richard.

816
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:27,101
要成为演员，你需要
进入特定的社交圈层，
To be an actor, you will need to
move in certain social spheres,

817
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:32,518
正好皇家空军有个新设立的
半年期奖学金项目，
and, as it happens, the RAF
have a new six-month scholarship

818
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:36,000
可以让几名学员
去牛津大学进修。
for several cadets
to study at Oxford University.

819
01:02:37,334 --> 01:02:41,000
而我朋友西里尔·库克爵士
负责这个项目
And my friend, Sir Cyril Cooke,
is in charge

820
01:02:42,167 --> 01:02:43,351
牛津？
Oxford?

821
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:45,851
对，牛津。
Oxford, yes.

822
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:49,500
但你的成绩必须非常优秀
所以...
But, uh your marks
will need to be excellent So.

823
01:02:50,459 --> 01:02:52,351
从现在开始你有一小时
You have an hour from now

824
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:55,018
如果分数没有提高，
and if you do not better your mark,

825
01:02:55,042 --> 01:02:56,500
我会再给你安排重考。
I will set you another.

826
01:02:59,417 --> 01:03:00,625
好的，PH老师。
Yes, PH.

827
01:03:02,167 --> 01:03:03,417
对了理查德？
Oh, and Richard?

828
01:03:04,334 --> 01:03:07,893
如果你继续
在约谈时迟到，
If you continue to be late
for our appointments,

829
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:10,768
我可能不得不
重新考虑我们的约定。
I may be forced
to reconsider our arrangement.

830
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:13,375
明白我的意思吗？
Do I make myself clear?

831
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,625
抱歉。
Sorry.

832
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:08,417
我那个...
I, um.

833
01:04:10,209 --> 01:04:11,584
呃...
Uh.

834
01:04:13,792 --> 01:04:16,209
PH老师，我不知道
您还给剧院写剧本。
I didn't know you was writing
for the theatre, PH.

835
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,625
是的。
Yes.

836
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:25,084
不过如你所见
Although, as you can see

837
01:04:26,834 --> 01:04:30,792
HM坦南特公司
并不满意。
not to the satisfaction
of HM Tennent Limited.

838
01:04:32,792 --> 01:04:35,125
但您的作品
对BBC来说足够好了。
Well, your work's good enough
for the BBC.

839
01:04:36,792 --> 01:04:39,792
BBC地方台而已。
A regional service of the BBC.

840
01:04:41,834 --> 01:04:44,584
我本来有机会去伦敦工作...
I did have a job in London We...

841
01:04:45,917 --> 01:04:47,750
至少收到过工作邀约。
The offer of a job, at least.

842
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:50,917
但后来战争爆发了。
But then the war broke out.

843
01:04:55,042 --> 01:04:58,417
您是说，您其实
不想当老师？
You mean, you don't want
to be a teacher?

844
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:03,542
不，别误会。
No Don't misunderstand me.

845
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:08,310
我认为教书是崇高的职业
I believe teaching is a noble profession

846
01:05:08,334 --> 01:05:09,726
只是没想到
I suppose I didn't think

847
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:12,334
会花大半辈子做这个。
I'd spend so much of my life doing it.

848
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:17,310
但劳工部认为
But the Ministry of Labour

849
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:20,685
以我的才能
considers my talents, such as they are,

850
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:25,209
更适合教书
而不是去广播大厦工作。
better suited to the classroom
than Broadcasting House.

851
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:27,375
所以就这样了。
And thus.

852
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:32,292
我与伦敦戏剧界渐行渐远。
I fell out of step with the London stage.

853
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:38,268
那你后来还写过其他剧本吗？
So, have you written other plays, then?

854
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:40,209
可能写得太多了。
Too many, perhaps.

855
01:05:48,917 --> 01:05:51,042
所以即便屡遭挫折
So, writing must also be pursued

856
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:55,000
也必须坚持写作。
in spite of discouragement.

857
01:05:58,042 --> 01:05:59,250
我想确实如此。
I suppose it must.

858
01:06:06,334 --> 01:06:09,875
PH，没人比你更懂戏剧。
PH, no one understands the stage
like you.

859
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:12,935
这点我非常确定
I know that for certain

860
01:06:12,959 --> 01:06:16,667
我是说你的导演工作。
I mean, your work as a director.

861
01:06:19,167 --> 01:06:22,268
我总怀着惊叹欣赏。
I watch it in wonder I do.

862
01:06:22,292 --> 01:06:24,084
要不是你在这儿
And if you hadn't been h'yere

863
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:30,667
在这儿。
Been here.

864
01:06:33,834 --> 01:06:36,084
我们", 真难说。
We", I dunno.

865
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:39,459
可能永远都不会相识。
We never would have met.

866
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:44,875
我得给你看个东西。
I must show you something.

867
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:06,018
虽然只是些小角色，
Now, they are only minor roles,

868
01:07:06,042 --> 01:07:07,893
但竞争会非常激烈。
and there will be fierce competition.

869
01:07:07,917 --> 01:07:09,667
"埃姆林想要威尔士演员。"
"Emlyn wants Welsh actors."

870
01:07:11,209 --> 01:07:12,935
"埃姆林·威廉姆斯先生正在寻找
"Mr Emlyn Williams is looking for

871
01:07:12,959 --> 01:07:14,560
多名威尔士演员

01:07:14,584 --> 01:07:16,351
参演其新剧中的小角色"。
for small parts in his new play".

873
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:20,185
"所需类型从年轻人到性格演员不等"
"Types wanted vary from young
people to character actors"

874
01:07:20,209 --> 01:07:22,685
我可以转达我们的意向。
I could inform him of our interest.

875
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:23,935
是<i>你</i>的意向。
Of <i>your</i> interest.

876

埃姆林·威廉姆斯

877
01:07:25,209 --> 01:07:29,042
我确实和威廉姆斯有些交情。
I do know Williams a bit.

878
01:07:35,959 --> 01:07:37,459
谢谢。
Thank you.

879
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:43,625
你该休息了。
You should get some sleep.

880
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,709
愿有烈火诗神
O for a Muse of fire

881
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:16,810
助我登临
that would ascend

882
01:08:16,834 --> 01:08:19,709
灵思最璀璨的天庭。
the brightest heaven of invention.

883
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:25,143
以王国为舞台，王公当演员
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act

884
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:28,500
帝王列座观此恢弘场景。
and monarchs to behold
the swelling scene.

885
01:08:30,334 --> 01:08:36,750
继而战神般的哈里王，本色登场，
Then, should the warlike Harry,
like himself,

886
01:08:38,292 --> 01:08:41,268
尽显战神威仪，
assume the port of Mars,

887
01:08:41,292 --> 01:08:44,810
身后饥馑、兵戈与烈焰如猎犬匍匐，
and at his heels, leashed in like hounds,

888
01:08:44,834 --> 01:08:49,334
静候差遣
should famine, sword and fire
crouch for employment

889
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:59,292
西里尔，这孩子最近确实判若两人。
He really is a changed boy
these days, Cyril.

890
01:09:00,959 --> 01:09:04,601
参加空训队，加入消防值班，
In the ATC, on the fire-watch rota,

891
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:09,000
成绩也突飞猛进。
and his marks have improved
beyond all recognition.

892
01:09:10,542 --> 01:09:14,101
我一向尊重你的判断，PH
Well, you know I respect
your judgement, PH

893
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:15,435
自然会支持你。
I will support you, of course.

894
01:09:15,459 --> 01:09:20,084
不过坦白说，我预见到些问题。
Although, to be candid,
I do foresee certain problems.

895
01:09:23,084 --> 01:09:26,542
比如他的出身，是矿工之子吧？
His background, for instance
He's a miner's son, isn't he?

896
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:30,893
当然我对矿工子弟绝无偏见，
Not that I have anything against
miners' sons, of course,

897
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:35,375
但牛津剑桥向来不青睐这类生源。
but, um, they are hardly the
type that Oxbridge smiles on.

898
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:37,875
此外
And then

899
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:41,375
还有姓氏问题。
there is the matter of the surname.

900
01:09:42,334 --> 01:09:43,542
这...什么意思？
How How do you mean?

901
01:09:44,542 --> 01:09:47,334
孩子姓詹金斯，而你姓伯顿。
The boy's name is Jenkins
Yours is Burton.

902
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:50,810
他和你住在一起
He lives with you

903
01:09:50,834 --> 01:09:53,542
这难免会引发一些疑问。
and it will inevitably lead to questions.

904
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:57,750
而且皇家空军奖学金竞争如此激烈。
And with competition for
the RAF scholarship so fierce.

905
01:10:01,209 --> 01:10:04,518
总之，最好抓紧时间
这场战争不会自己打赢。
Anyhow, best get on
This war isn't winning itself.

906
01:10:04,542 --> 01:10:07,917
是的是的，当然 谢谢您，西里尔爵士。
Yes Yes, of course Thank you, Sir Cyril.

907
01:10:10,917 --> 01:10:14,851
听着，PH，我知道在这个时代
Look, PH, I know a man's name
shouldn't hold him back

908
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:18,792
一个人的名字不该成为阻碍
in this day and age, but
you know how these things work

909
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:30,935
水珠在滴落
The drops are dripping

910
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:35,560
那是迪克·詹金斯的儿子
That's Dic Jenkins's boy, that is

911
01:10:35,584 --> 01:10:36,875
不会吧？
It's not, is it?

912
01:10:37,042 --> 01:10:38,393
和那个老师住在一起
Living with that teacher

913
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:40,518
- 猜猜他图什么。
- 是啊
- Guess what he's after.
- Yeah

914
01:10:53,042 --> 01:10:54,750
再来点茶吗，PH？
More tea, PH?

915
01:10:58,084 --> 01:11:01,375
哦好的 谢谢你，理查德。
Oh Yes Thank you, Richard.

916
01:11:09,417 --> 01:11:10,625
理查德。
Richard.

917
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:17,851
我们需要讨论你申请
We need to discuss your
application for a scholarship

918
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:19,334
牛津大学奖学金的事。
to Oxford University.

919
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:21,750
好的。
Right.

920
01:11:23,584 --> 01:11:26,834
你知道，这是个难得的机会。
As you know,
this is an enormous opportunity.

921
01:11:27,792 --> 01:11:29,018
而且幸运的是，
And, thankfully,

922
01:11:29,042 --> 01:11:33,334
西里尔爵士已同意支持这次申请。
Sir Cyril has agreed
to support the application.

923
01:11:35,042 --> 01:11:36,375
太好了。
Lovely.

924
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:40,226
但有个条件。
But there is a a caveat.

925
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:45,018
他认为我以关心你的老师身份推荐你
He believes that my putting you forward

926
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:48,851
会引发关于你居住安排的尴尬问题。
as a concerned teacher

927
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:53,834
我明白了。
will raise awkward questions
about your living arrangements.

928
01:11:57,459 --> 01:11:58,459
要让我的推荐
I see.

929
01:12:00,834 --> 01:12:03,042
毫无异议地被接受，
For me to put you forward,

930
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:07,268
就需要我
and for that to be accepted
without question,

931
01:12:07,292 --> 01:12:09,268
对你承担法律责任。
would require me to

932
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:12,875
什么意思，法律责任？
to take legal responsibility for you.

933
01:12:14,834 --> 01:12:16,459
收养我？
What do you mean, legal?

934
01:12:22,667 --> 01:12:23,726
把这看作达到目的的手段，一种形式，但
Adopt me?

935
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:29,042
不可避免地，这需要你
Think of this as a means
to an end, a formality, but

936
01:12:30,459 --> 01:12:33,643
改我的名字？
inevitably, this would require you to.

937
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:35,125
行。
Change my name?

938
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:53,917
改吧。
Fine.

939
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:56,875
好的。
Change it.

940
01:13:01,834 --> 01:13:02,875
呃，要做到这点，
Right.

941
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:07,542
我们需要你现任法定监护人的许可。
Um, in order to do that,

942
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:12,750
是谁？是西斯吗？
we would need the permission
of your current legal guardian.

943
01:13:14,167 --> 01:13:17,125
不，恐怕不是
Who's that? Is it Cis?

944
01:13:19,084 --> 01:13:21,417
这该死的到底是谁？
No I'm afraid not

945
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:47,875
这能让我上大学。
Who the bloody hell is this?

946
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,875
甚至可能是牛津。
It would a"ow me to go to university.

947
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,042
我需要你签字。
Perhaps even to Oxford.

948
01:14:31,542 --> 01:14:32,792
"婴儿理查德·沃尔特·詹金斯，
I need you to sign it.

五十英镑？
Fifty pounds?

962
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:30,000
你想要什么面额的钞票？
And how would you like the notes?

963
01:16:31,042 --> 01:16:33,417
呃，五英镑面额的就行
Uh, five-pound notes will be fine

964

965
01:17:03,959 --> 01:17:05,685

嗯
Hmm

却从未索取过任何回报。
and I have asked for nothing in return.

1008
01:21:50,834 --> 01:21:55,560
除了希望看到你在演艺事业上有所成就。
Nothing, except to
to see you flourish as an actor.

1009
01:21:55,584 --> 01:21:59,584
是的，或许还期待一点感激之情，但老天爷啊。
Yes, perhaps a little gratitude,
but good God.

casting director in the country.

1014

而且她会特别关注你的表现。
And she will be paying you
particular attention.

1015
01:22:17,292 --> 01:22:19,893
你觉得这些机会都是凭空而来的吗？
Do you suppose these things
happen by chance?

1016
01:22:19,917 --> 01:22:25,060
还是说...你觉得你有什么特别之处？是这样吗？
Or-or-or are you in some way
special? Is that it?

1017
01:22:25,084 --> 01:22:26,250
理查德？

回答我，是不是？
Well, is it?

01:23:30,417 --> 01:23:33,476
里奇，你到底在干什么？
Richie What on earth are you doing?

1020
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:37,042
快下来，我们需要谈谈
Come down, will you?
I need to talk to you

1021
01:24:56,792 --> 01:24:59,518
妈妈，昨晚打扰到您我很抱歉
I am sorry if we disturbed
you last night, Ma

1022

不，你们没有打扰我。

1023
01:25:07,084 --> 01:25:09,125
我给你泡杯茶吧。
Let me make you some tea.

1024
01:25:10,417 --> 01:25:12,917
恐怕我们得给您找新房客了。
I am afraid we may have
to find you a new tenant.

1025
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:27,667
伯顿先生。
Mr Burton.

1026
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:33,560
我不想说我早就担心会这样，
I don't want to say that
I was afraid this would happen,

1027
01:25:33,584 --> 01:25:35,792
因为...我明白。
because - I know.

1028
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:42,393
我不想说里奇的坏话，
I don't want to speak ill of Richie,

1029
01:25:42,417 --> 01:25:44,351
尽管他的行为如此恶劣
however terribly he's behaved

1030
01:25:44,375 --> 01:25:47,000
因为我真的很喜欢这个孩子。
because I've become so fond of the boy.

1031
01:25:50,334 --> 01:25:53,101
还记得基督教青年会那场首演吗？
Do you remember
that first play at the YMCA?

1032
01:25:53,125 --> 01:25:54,792
我们...
We...

1033
01:25:55,709 --> 01:25:59,292
他从一开始就是这样对我的。
That's how he's been to me,
right from the start.

1034
01:26:00,417 --> 01:26:05,000
可以说是胆怯又戒备。
Scared and hunted, I suppose you'd say.

1035
01:26:08,709 --> 01:26:11,351
就算我们给予他全世界的善意，
We could have given him
all the kindness in the world,

1036
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:15,292
也永远改变不了这一点。
and nothing was ever
going to change that, ever.

1037
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:22,518
但他居然这样回报我？
"But to throw it a" back at me?

1038
01:26:22,542 --> 01:26:24,226
我知道。
I know.

1039
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:27,250
但还有谁呢，伯顿先生？
But who else, Mr Burton?

1040
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:29,625
您应该明白。
You must know that.

1041
01:26:31,917 --> 01:26:35,750
他还在乎过谁呢？
Who else does he care about so much?

1042
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:59,476
我们需要找的是个男孩
I'm afraid it is a boy
we are looking for

1043
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:01,810
但她可以女扮男装啊，赖小姐，不是吗？
But she could pass
for a boy, Miss Rye, isn't it?

1044
01:27:01,834 --> 01:27:03,435
毕竟现在是在打仗期间。
There is a war on, after all.

1045
01:27:03,459 --> 01:27:06,476
是的，巴伦太太，但我们需要的是个男孩。
Yes, Mrs Barron, but it is a boy
we are looking for.

1046
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,584
请坐到左边去。
Please, take a seat to the left.

1047
01:27:11,417 --> 01:27:12,792
唐纳德·布朗。
Donald Brown.

1048
01:27:15,292 --> 01:27:16,625
唐纳德·布朗？
Donald Brown?

1049
01:27:18,042 --> 01:27:19,584
不在？好吧。
No? Very we.

1050
01:27:21,875 --> 01:27:23,167
理查德·伯顿
Richard Burton

1051
01:27:24,084 --> 01:27:26,042
站直了
Stand up straight

1052
01:27:32,084 --> 01:27:35,167
别忘了保持微笑。
Don't forget to smile.

1053
01:27:38,167 --> 01:27:40,792
啊，没错。你是菲利普·伯顿的徒弟。
Ah, yes You're Philip Burton's boy.

1054
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:44,500
是的，莱伊小姐。
Yes, Miss Rye.

1055
01:27:46,334 --> 01:27:47,500
我，呃...
I, um.

1056
01:27:51,084 --> 01:27:53,750
您发来的台词...我都背下来了。
I've, uh, I've memorised
the lines you sent.

1057
01:27:57,292 --> 01:27:58,292
那就开始吧。
Carry on, then.

1058
01:28:06,792 --> 01:28:08,560
干草还没收完
What do I want with stories

1059
01:28:08,584 --> 01:28:10,250
我哪有心思听故事？
when I got the hay to get in?

1060
01:28:13,209 --> 01:28:15,875
自从被种马摔伤卧床后
I 'aven't read a story,
not since I was in bed

1061
01:28:16,042 --> 01:28:17,625
我就再没读过故事了。
from the stallion throwin' me.

1062
01:28:18,834 --> 01:28:20,792
我得想些别的事。
I got to think about other things.

1063
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:23,042
比如姑娘们。
Like girls.

1064
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:26,893
还有明天的天气会怎样
And what is the sky like for tomorrow

1065
01:28:26,917 --> 01:28:28,625
以及一品脱啤酒的滋味。
and the taste of a pint.

1066
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:34,393
当然还有姑娘们。
And girls.

1067
01:28:34,417 --> 01:28:36,542
谢谢。能看看你的侧脸吗？
Thank you May I see your profile?

1068
01:28:45,209 --> 01:28:46,969
想看另一侧也行，随你便。
You can see the other
side too, if you like.

1069
01:28:49,834 --> 01:28:52,084
两边差别很大吗？
Is it particularly different?

1070
01:28:53,292 --> 01:28:54,709
你来说说看。
You tell me.

1071
01:28:58,709 --> 01:29:00,917
天呐，你可真够大胆的，不是吗？
Dear me, you are a bold one, aren't you?

1072
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,750
你根本想象不到。
You cannot imagine.

1073
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:10,476
你的时间安排？你现在在皇家空军？
And your availability? You're in the RAF?

1074
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,685
我看到菲利普提到奖学金的事。
I see Philip mentions a scholarship.

1075
01:29:12,709 --> 01:29:16,167
是的。四月份皇家空军会送我去牛津，
Yes In April, the RAF
are sending me to Oxford.

1076
01:29:17,375 --> 01:29:18,542
埃克塞特学院。
Exeter College.

1077
01:29:19,667 --> 01:29:22,334
在那之前，我的时间都归您安排。
Till then, my time is yours.

1078
01:29:26,209 --> 01:29:28,334
请留下来坐会儿吧。
Stay and take a seat, if you would.

1079
01:29:38,667 --> 01:29:39,875
大卫·塞西尔。
David Cecil.

1080
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:53,226
- 大卫 很高兴又见面了
- 我也很高兴见到你
- David Lovely to see you again.
- Nice to see you too.

1081
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:55,685
剧本收到了吗？
Did you receive the play?

1082
01:30:10,834 --> 01:30:15,018
那么，可爱的浪子啊，等你当上国王后
Marry, then sweet wag,
when thou art king,

1083
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:18,351
可别让我们这些夜的随从
let not us that are squires
of the night's body

1084
01:30:18,375 --> 01:30:20,584
被称作白昼之美的窃贼
be called thieves of the day's beauty.

1085
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:23,209
你说得对
Thou sayest well,

1086
01:30:24,917 --> 01:30:27,101
因为我们这些月亮的子民
for the fortune of us
that are the moon's men

1087
01:30:27,125 --> 01:30:28,685
命运就像潮汐般涨落
doth ebb and flow like the sea

1088
01:30:28,709 --> 01:30:30,768
正如大海受月亮牵引
being governed, as the sea is,
by the moon.

1089
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:35,084
不，理查德 这些都是喜剧场景
No, Richard These are comic scenes.

1090
01:30:36,042 --> 01:30:38,601
就不能演得轻松些吗？
Can't you make it a little lighter?

1091
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:42,768
哈尔是个逃学者，是个追求享乐
Hal is a truant,
a boy who seeks enjoyment

1092
01:30:42,792 --> 01:30:44,875
而非体面的少年
rather than respectability.

1093
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:49,375
就像你总提醒我的那样
As you keep telling me.

1094
01:30:53,375 --> 01:30:59,834
那么，你到底哪里没理解？
So, what exactly are you failing to grasp?

1095
01:31:01,792 --> 01:31:04,000
你自己不也在追求享乐吗？
You yourself seek enjoyment,
do you not?

1096
01:31:05,125 --> 01:31:06,875
据我所见简直是日夜不停
Day and bloody night, as far as I can tell.

1097
01:31:07,042 --> 01:31:09,500
事实上无处不在，除了这里这个关键场合
Everywhere, in fact,
except here, where it matters.

1098
01:31:11,334 --> 01:31:13,000
五点了 - 谢谢
It's five o'clock - Thank you

1099
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,709
理查
Rich.

1100
01:31:39,375 --> 01:31:41,042
这是最后一次机会
That is your last.

1101
01:31:43,042 --> 01:31:46,351
明白吗？你必须振作起来
Do you understand? You need
to pull yourself together

1102
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:48,893
我完好无损
I am perfectly intact

1103
01:31:48,917 --> 01:31:51,185
你喝得烂醉如泥
You are arseholed.

1104
01:31:51,209 --> 01:31:53,143
理查德，再说一次
换其他演员早就妥协了
Again, Richard,
any other actor would give.

1105
01:31:53,167 --> 01:31:54,334
演员！
Actors!

1106
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:56,084
演员！
Actors!

1107
01:31:57,584 --> 01:31:59,750
我他妈恨透演员了
I fucking hate actors.

1108
01:32:01,042 --> 01:32:03,459
还有他们那些该死的化妆品
Them and their their make-up.

1109
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:09,500
你说说看
什么样的男人会涂脂抹粉？
You know, what kind of man
wears make-up? I ask you that.

1110
01:32:14,709 --> 01:32:18,875
容我再次提醒您
Give me leave to tell you
once again that at my birth

1111
01:32:19,042 --> 01:32:22,917
我出生时天象异变
the front of heaven
was full of fiery shapes.

1112
01:32:24,167 --> 01:32:25,292
他来了
Here he is.

1113
01:32:26,542 --> 01:32:28,500
英格兰的格伦道尔
The English Glendower.

1114
01:32:30,542 --> 01:32:34,185
看啊 威尔士亲王哈尔
And behold, the Welsh Prince Hall

1115
01:32:34,209 --> 01:32:37,060
简直是奇耻大辱
The indignity of it

1116
01:32:37,084 --> 01:32:38,560
梅尔
Mel

1117
01:32:38,584 --> 01:32:41,584
给那个醉醺醺的矿工儿子当替补
Understudy to the drunken son
of a drunken bloody miner.

1118
01:32:43,875 --> 01:32:45,000
什么？
What?

1119
01:32:47,917 --> 01:32:49,643
开个玩笑而已 理查
It was just a joke, Rich.

1120
01:32:49,667 --> 01:32:51,125
不过咱们实话实说
Although, let's face it.

1121
01:32:58,792 --> 01:33:00,000
说什么实话？
Let's face what?

1122
01:33:12,042 --> 01:33:13,167
理查！
Rich!

1123
01:33:14,417 --> 01:33:17,101
天啊 你把我鼻子打断了！
Jesus Christ You broke my nose!

1124
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:19,935
- 只是擦伤
- 理查德 跟我来
- It's just a scratch.
- Richard, come with me.

1125
01:33:19,959 --> 01:33:22,042
终于 我还以为你永远不会屈服
At last I thought
you would never capitulate.

1126
01:33:22,709 --> 01:33:25,167
别弄脏我的衬衫和领带
Make sure it doesn't go on my shirt or tie.

1127
01:33:31,459 --> 01:33:33,685
你他妈到底有什么毛病？
Just what the hell is wrong with you?

1128
01:33:33,709 --> 01:33:36,268
离首演只剩四天了
Four bloody days until opening night

1129
01:33:36,292 --> 01:33:39,060
我跟托尼说过
这个角色非你莫属
I told Tony you were
the only actor for the part.

1130
01:33:39,084 --> 01:33:41,750
我向他保证会搞定你
And I promised him I would sort you out.

1131
01:33:46,292 --> 01:33:47,500
你？
You?

1132
01:33:49,084 --> 01:33:50,667
搞定我？
Sort me out?

1133
01:33:57,917 --> 01:33:59,459
没人能搞定我
Nobody can sort me out.

1134
01:34:02,667 --> 01:34:06,209
理查德 我的忍耐是有限度的
Richard, I do in fact have a limit

1135
01:34:42,709 --> 01:34:44,709
399号 史密斯夫人
399, Mrs Smith speaking.

1136
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,209
哦 小理查
Oh, Rich Richie

1137
01:34:49,042 --> 01:34:51,042
理查 怎么了？
Richie, Richie, what's the matter?

1138
01:34:52,542 --> 01:34:55,810
不 理查 现在太晚了
Uh No, Richie, no
Richie, no, it's terribly late.

1139
01:34:55,834 --> 01:34:58,167
都凌晨一点了 真的不行
It's gone one o'clock I couldn't possibly.

1140
01:34:59,167 --> 01:35:01,375
别这样 嘘——
No, Richie Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1141
01:35:08,334 --> 01:35:09,542
妈
Ma.

1142
01:35:11,459 --> 01:35:13,393
我不确定这是好主意
"I'm not at a" sure this is a good idea

1143
01:35:13,417 --> 01:35:14,768
我觉得该给他打个电话
I think I should telephone him.

1144
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:17,643
伯顿先生 他现在肯定还在昏睡
Mr Burton, there's not a cat's
chance that he's awake yet.

1145
01:35:17,667 --> 01:35:19,560
昨晚他醉得不省人事
He was very much the worse for wear.

1146
01:35:19,584 --> 01:35:23,310
但他明确表示急需见你
But he made it clear
that he needs you, urgently.

1147
01:35:23,334 --> 01:35:25,768
- 可就这样离开...
- 我会去学校
- But just to leave like.
- I shall call by the school

1148
01:35:25,792 --> 01:35:27,500
说明一下情况
and explain the situation.

1149
01:35:30,084 --> 01:35:34,351
伯顿先生 理查现在归你管
Now, Mr Burton,
Richie is your responsibility.

1150
01:35:34,375 --> 01:35:36,435
我知道你们上次闹得不愉快
Now, I know that you didn't
part on the best terms,

1151
01:35:36,459 --> 01:35:40,209
但你必须负起这个责任
but the fact remains, this is your duty.

1152
01:35:41,042 --> 01:35:43,042
如果他需要你，你就必须去
If he needs you, then you must go

1153
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:48,601
伯顿先生。
Mr Burton.

1154
01:36:48,625 --> 01:36:50,125
理查德。
Richard.

1155
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:54,459
啊
Ah

1156
01:36:55,417 --> 01:36:58,042
你不记得了，呃。
You don't recall, uh.

1157
01:36:59,542 --> 01:37:03,834
你昨晚和史密斯夫人
通过电话。
You spoke to Mrs Smith
on the telephone last night.

1158
01:37:10,667 --> 01:37:11,834
天啊。
Dear God.

1159
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:15,792
我当时一定是喝醉了
I must have been drunk

1160
01:37:22,167 --> 01:37:23,417
那么"妈"还好吗？
Is Ma we", then?

1161
01:37:25,334 --> 01:37:27,459
她身体非常健康。
She is in excellent health.

1162
01:37:30,042 --> 01:37:31,125
很好。
Good.

1163
01:37:34,834 --> 01:37:37,560
好了各位，我们继续。
A" right, everyone, we are moving on.

1164
01:37:37,584 --> 01:37:40,768
我们回到
<i>第一部分</i>第三幕第二场
We're going back to
<i>Part I,</i> Act Three, Scene Two

1165
01:37:40,792 --> 01:37:44,185
哈里，请你站到这里来，
舞台左侧，理查德站这里。
Harry, if I could have you here,
upstage left, and Richard here.

1166
01:37:44,209 --> 01:37:46,875
哦，王座会放在这里，
舞台右侧前方，
Oh, and the throne will be
down here, downstage right,

1167
01:37:47,042 --> 01:37:49,518
头顶会有美妙的白色灯光。
with a marvellous white light from above.

1168
01:37:49,542 --> 01:37:52,268
好 开始吧
贵族们刚刚散开。
All right Here we are
The lords have just scattered.

1169
01:37:52,292 --> 01:37:54,834
国王，王子...谢谢你，哈里。
The King, the Prince Thank you, Harry.

1170
01:37:56,834 --> 01:37:59,310
我不知道是否上帝如此安排
I know not whether God will have it so

1171
01:37:59,334 --> 01:38:02,101
因我某些不敬之举，
for some displeasing service
I have done,

1172
01:38:02,125 --> 01:38:04,875
但你在人生历程中
but thou dost in thy passages of life

1173
01:38:05,042 --> 01:38:07,268
让我深信
make me believe
that thou art only marked

1174
01:38:07,292 --> 01:38:09,226
你是上天派来
for the hot vengeance

1175
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:12,893
用炽热复仇之火
惩罚我误入歧途的使者。
and the rod of heaven
to punish my mistreadings.

1176
01:38:12,917 --> 01:38:15,393
陛下明鉴，但愿我能
So please Your Majesty, I would I could

1177
01:38:15,417 --> 01:38:17,625
"洗清"所有罪过，我。
"quit a" offences, I.

1178
01:38:22,084 --> 01:38:23,226
嗯。
Um.

1179
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:24,393
能"洗清"吗？
Could a"?

1180
01:38:24,417 --> 01:38:27,667
用如此清白...不 我想起来了。
With as clear - No I have it.

1181
01:38:31,167 --> 01:38:32,834
我 我会的。
I I shall.

1182
01:38:33,334 --> 01:38:34,476
我会的。
I shall.

1183
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:35,851
我，呃
I, uh

1184
01:38:35,875 --> 01:38:40,167
从今往后，我仁慈的君主，
I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,

1185
01:38:41,584 --> 01:38:43,060
定当改过自新。
be more myself.

1186
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:46,060
理查德，你跳过了整整一页。
You skipped an entire page
there, Richard.

1187
01:38:46,084 --> 01:38:48,601
离演出只剩几天了，
你还没脱稿。
We're a matter of days away,
and you're still not off-book.

1188
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:49,851
是的，我意识到了。
Yes, I am aware of that.

1189
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:53,709
我们再来一次
呃，达芙妮？
We will do that again
Uh, Daphne?

1190
01:38:56,875 --> 01:38:59,476
这个人在我的排练室做什么？
Who is this person
in my rehearsal room?

1191
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:01,292
"他跟我一起的，托尼"稍后解释。
"He's with me, Tony I'" explain later.

1192
01:39:02,292 --> 01:39:04,226
好了，我们继续吧。
A" right, let's get on with it.

1193
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:06,060
让我们从头再来一遍
Let's pick it up again from the top

1194
01:39:06,084 --> 01:39:08,042
哈里，请按你的节奏来
Harry, please, in your own time

1195
01:39:15,042 --> 01:39:16,084
理查德。
Richard.

1196
01:39:19,417 --> 01:39:22,125
距离我上次来斯特拉特福
已经四年了。
It's been four years
since I was last in Stratford.

1197
01:39:22,625 --> 01:39:25,917
我要去圣三一教堂
表达敬意。
I shall go to the Holy Trinity,
pay my respects.

1198
01:39:27,292 --> 01:39:28,792
你去过墓地了吗？
You've visited the grave?

1199
01:39:31,417 --> 01:39:32,625
还没。
No Not yet.

1200
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:36,584
那么。
So.

1201
01:39:37,834 --> 01:39:39,000
你觉得怎么样？
What did you think?

1202
01:39:41,042 --> 01:39:42,726
很好。
Good.

1203
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:45,584
是的，呃，有意思。
Yes, uh Interesting.

1204
01:39:47,042 --> 01:39:49,459
你想不想——很好
Do you want to - Good

1205
01:39:50,959 --> 01:39:52,601
很好。
Good.

1206
01:39:52,625 --> 01:39:54,375
那我今天的工作就到此为止。
Then I'm finished for the day.

1207
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:08,334
要来一杯吗？
Care for one?

1208
01:40:08,959 --> 01:40:12,125
不，呃，我就不用了，谢谢。
No, uh, not for me, thanks.

1209
01:40:18,167 --> 01:40:21,417
要知道，我是个矿工的儿子。
You see, I am the son of a miner.

1210
01:40:23,042 --> 01:40:25,709
矿工一到五点就开始喝酒。
At five o'clock, a miner starts drinking.

1211
01:40:28,959 --> 01:40:30,375
当然。
Of course.

1212
01:40:31,084 --> 01:40:32,459
好吧，我。
Well, I.

1213
01:40:33,834 --> 01:40:36,000
"我祝愿你"一切顺利。
"I wish you a" the very best with it.

1214
01:40:39,834 --> 01:40:41,042
那就继续吧。
Go on then.

1215
01:40:43,375 --> 01:40:44,875
告诉我你的想法。
Te" me your thoughts.

1216
01:40:46,042 --> 01:40:47,084
给。
Here.

1217
01:40:55,084 --> 01:40:59,310
"老实说，理查德，
我的想法是这样的。
We", candidly, Richard,
my thoughts are these.

1218
01:40:59,334 --> 01:41:02,268
首先，你不是矿工，
Firstly, you are not a miner,

1219
01:41:02,292 --> 01:41:04,042
你是个演员。
you're an actor.

1220
01:41:04,875 --> 01:41:06,726
你是个只有三天时间的演员
You're an actor with three days

1221
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:10,393
来挽救可能是你职业生涯中
最重要的机会。
to salvage what might be
the opportunity of your career.

1222
01:41:10,417 --> 01:41:13,476
这个机会能让你在世界
最负盛名的剧院里
The chance to establish yourself
as a classical actor

1223
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:16,042
确立自己作为古典演员的地位。
in the most prestigious theatre
in the world.

1224
01:41:17,834 --> 01:41:20,875
你难道不明白这有多重要吗？
Do you not understand
the magnitude of that?

1225
01:41:23,209 --> 01:41:24,851
有点——很好。
Somewhat - Good.

1226
01:41:24,875 --> 01:41:29,417
那我建议我们找点吃的，然后开始工作。
Then I propose we find some food
and get down to work.

1227
01:41:31,459 --> 01:41:34,435
"我了解你"，并将暂时容忍
"I know you a", and will awhile uphold

1228
01:41:34,459 --> 01:41:37,310
你那不受约束的懒散幽默"。
the unyoked humour of your idleness".

1229
01:41:37,334 --> 01:41:39,268
"但在此我将效仿太阳。"
"Yet herein will I imitate the sun."

1230
01:41:39,292 --> 01:41:40,792
再来一次。
Try again.

1231
01:41:47,875 --> 01:41:49,375
"我了解你"，
"I know you a",

1232
01:41:50,959 --> 01:41:52,893
并将暂时容忍
and will awhile uphold

1233
01:41:52,917 --> 01:41:56,143
你那不受约束的懒散幽默"。
the unyoked humour of your idleness".

1234
01:41:56,167 --> 01:41:58,750
"但在此我将效仿太阳。"
"Yet herein will I imitate the sun."

1235
01:42:01,334 --> 01:42:05,226
你理解这个角色，理查德。
You understand this character, Richard.

1236
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:11,685
你知道他不是那种
拍大腿的轻浮青年。
You know that he's not
some thigh-slapping youth.

1237
01:42:11,709 --> 01:42:14,435
是的，哈尔是个年轻人，
Yes, Hal is a young man,

1238
01:42:14,459 --> 01:42:18,851
但他始终清楚自己的命运。
but he's always aware of his destiny.

1239
01:42:18,875 --> 01:42:20,351
那就是，在他父亲去世后，
That, on the death of his father,

1240
01:42:20,375 --> 01:42:23,226
他将不得不告别福斯塔夫
的玩世不恭
he will have to turn away
from Falstaff's irreverence

1241
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:26,685
和酒馆里的醉生梦死。
and the drunken life of the tavern.

1242
01:42:26,709 --> 01:42:31,268
他将蜕变为一位国王，
He will transform into a king,

1243
01:42:31,292 --> 01:42:33,060
并且，像国王一样，
and, like a king,

1244
01:42:33,084 --> 01:42:37,250
以身作则地领导他的国家。
lead his country
as a king must, by example.

1245
01:42:39,417 --> 01:42:42,500
你必须相信自己的直觉，理查德。
You must trust your instincts, Richard.

1246
01:42:44,417 --> 01:42:46,792
好了，停！停，停！
All right, stop Stop, stop!

1247
01:42:47,834 --> 01:42:50,875
我让你喊，你却小声说；
我让你笑，你却——
I tell you to shout, and you
whisper I tell you to laugh

1248
01:42:51,042 --> 01:42:52,882
我不是来给你那些搞笑台词
当捧哏的。
I am not some straight man
to your funny lines.

1249
01:42:53,042 --> 01:42:54,518
这是场喜剧戏。
It is a comic scene.

1250
01:42:54,542 --> 01:42:57,768
我们在酒馆里，这是个粗俗的世界。
We're in the tavern, a world of ribaldry.

1251
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:59,935
听着，你为什么不试试这样做。
Look, why don't you try doing it like.

1252
01:42:59,959 --> 01:43:01,893
我绝不会用其他方式演绎
There is no other way I will be doing it

1253
01:43:01,917 --> 01:43:03,810
理查德，我才是导演！
Richard, I am your director!

1254
01:43:03,834 --> 01:43:06,810
你只能呈现我的表演版本 别人的不行
And you shall have
my performance Nobody else's.

1255
01:43:06,834 --> 01:43:11,435
别人的不行？那他<i>在这儿</i>干什么？
Nobody else's? Then what exactly
is <i>he</i> doing here?

1256
01:43:11,459 --> 01:43:14,476
托尼 说真的 我觉得你应该接受这个改编
Tony Tony, honestly,
I think you should go with it

1257
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:17,042
虽然与众不同 但效果确实不错
I know it's different,
but I think it is working.

1258
01:43:19,167 --> 01:43:21,393
该死的威尔士佬
Bloody Welsh.

1259
01:43:21,417 --> 01:43:23,393
你们翻山越岭而来
Over the Marches you come,
out of the mountains,

1260
01:43:23,417 --> 01:43:26,209
劫掠我们的牲畜 从不为建设出力
raiding our cattle
You don't come to contribute.

1261
01:43:27,625 --> 01:43:30,375
就是群该死的强盗
You're just bloody raiders.

1262
01:43:59,625 --> 01:44:02,018
文法学校出身的平民小子
A grammar school boy.

1263
01:44:02,042 --> 01:44:05,125
既非王子 也非贵族
Not a prince Not a lord.

1264
01:44:07,209 --> 01:44:09,334
三百年过去了
Three hundred years

1265
01:44:10,375 --> 01:44:13,500
我们仍为他的文字倾倒
and we're still transported by his words.

1266
01:44:17,459 --> 01:44:18,834
明天见 里奇
Tomorrow, Richie.

1267
01:44:21,959 --> 01:44:23,584
吹响号角
Sound trumpets.

1268
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:28,792
让我们的战旗飘扬
Let our bloody colours wave.

1269
01:44:46,709 --> 01:44:48,000
不成功
And either victory

1270
01:44:50,959 --> 01:44:52,417
便成仁
or else a grave.

1271
01:45:17,709 --> 01:45:19,250
早啊 里奇
Morning, Rich.

1272
01:45:21,542 --> 01:45:22,750
蒂姆
Tim.

1273
01:45:25,584 --> 01:45:27,209
你朋友在找你
Your friend's looking for you.

1274
01:45:28,167 --> 01:45:31,000
那个...你的表演指导
Your, uh Your acting coach.

1275
01:45:33,792 --> 01:45:35,125
他不是我的表演指导
He's not my acting coach.

1276
01:45:36,584 --> 01:45:37,750
好吧 那...
Well, then, uh

1277
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:40,250
不管他是谁
you know, whoever he is.

1278
01:46:02,417 --> 01:46:05,834
我想讨论下加冕戏
I, uh, thought we might discuss
the coronation scene.

1279
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:12,310
我有六小时演出
I have a six-hour performance.

1280
01:46:12,334 --> 01:46:13,917
当然 但...
Of course Of course, but

1281
01:46:15,792 --> 01:46:19,226
这场戏结尾有句台词
there's a line towards
the end of the scene

1282
01:46:19,250 --> 01:46:21,768
能凸显角色经历的
which underlines
the scale of the transformation

1283
01:46:21,792 --> 01:46:23,209
巨大转变
he has undergone.

1284
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:28,875
我需要透口气
I need some air.

1285
01:46:31,375 --> 01:46:32,500
伯顿先生？
Mr Burton?

1286
01:46:34,292 --> 01:46:35,750
能签个名吗？
Would you mind signing this?

1287
01:46:45,209 --> 01:46:46,375
天呐 看看这个
Dear me, look at that.

1288
01:46:51,209 --> 01:46:53,250
他们到底在想什么鬼？
"What the he" were they thinking?

1289
01:46:57,042 --> 01:46:58,292
谢谢
Thank you

1290
01:47:07,417 --> 01:47:08,834
你还在这儿？
Are you still here?

1291
01:47:32,709 --> 01:47:33,875
里奇？
Richie?

1292
01:47:35,959 --> 01:47:38,459
怎么了？
Yes What is it?

1293
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:40,875
什么意思？
What do you mean?

1294
01:47:41,042 --> 01:47:43,667
我等了你将近两小时
I have been waiting for you
for nearly two hours.

1295
01:47:44,542 --> 01:47:47,709
等我准备好了自然会来
Yes And I will be along
when I'm good and ready

1296
01:47:48,709 --> 01:47:54,435
别忘了是你请我来帮忙的
Richie, I remind you,
I was summoned here to help you.

1297
01:47:54,459 --> 01:47:55,851
我也很忙
I, too, am a busy man.

1298
01:47:55,875 --> 01:47:57,584
你以为消失八年之后
Do you think you can just turn up

1299
01:47:59,167 --> 01:48:00,709
还能随叫随到？
after eight years?

1300
01:48:01,584 --> 01:48:05,560
整整八年 还想让我对你言听计从？
Eight bloody years And
and have me do your bidding?

1301
01:48:05,584 --> 01:48:07,459
当我还是你学生吗？
Like I'm your schoolboy again?

1302
01:48:08,167 --> 01:48:11,435
里奇 这里不方便说话 我们换个地方
Richie I cannot talk here Let's go away.

1303
01:48:11,459 --> 01:48:13,250
你他妈以为自己算老几？
Just who the hell do you think you are?

1304
01:48:14,959 --> 01:48:16,851
我可是这个该死的国家里
I am one of the most promising
young actors

1305
01:48:16,875 --> 01:48:18,417
最有前途的年轻演员之一
in this whole bloody country.

1306
01:48:20,542 --> 01:48:21,667
你呢？
And you?

1307
01:48:22,834 --> 01:48:24,125
提醒我一下
Remind me.

1308
01:48:25,084 --> 01:48:26,667
你又是谁？
Who are you?

1309
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:49,935
哦 里奇
Oh, Richie.

1310
01:48:49,959 --> 01:48:52,643
哦 里奇 妈
Oh, Richie - Ma.

1311
01:48:52,667 --> 01:48:56,084
见到你真是太高兴了
Oh, it's so wonderful to see you.

1312
01:48:56,750 --> 01:48:58,042
我知道
I know.

1313
01:48:59,167 --> 01:49:01,310
伯顿先生昨天打电话来了
Mr Burton telephoned yesterday

1314
01:49:01,334 --> 01:49:03,226
所以我告诉他
and so I told him
that we'd keep it a surprise.

1315
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:05,643
但他设法给我弄了张票
But he's managed to get me a ticket.

1316
01:49:05,667 --> 01:49:07,351
哦 里奇 你一定很自豪吧
Oh, Richie, you must be so proud.

1317
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:09,560
他说能弄到一张票
He said it was all he could do
just to get the one,

1318
01:49:09,584 --> 01:49:12,226
毕竟你们俩都在参与这部戏
what with both of you
working on the play, so.

01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:13,292
是啊

1320
01:49:15,042 --> 01:49:16,768
这地方是不是很棒？
Isn't this a wonderful place?

1321
01:49:16,792 --> 01:49:19,518
伯顿先生跟我讲过很多这里的事
Mr Burton has told me so much about it

1322
01:49:19,542 --> 01:49:21,792
真不敢相信我真的来了
I can't believe I'm really here.

1323
01:49:22,625 --> 01:49:23,834
哦 里奇
Oh, Richie.

1324
01:49:25,167 --> 01:49:28,584
<i>若终年皆是游乐假期</i>
<i>If all the year
were playing holidays</i>

1325
01:49:30,334 --> 01:49:34,000
<i>嬉戏将如劳作般令人厌倦</i>
<i>to sport would be as tedious as to work.</i>

1326
01:49:35,875 --> 01:49:39,000
<i>当我摒弃这放浪形骸</i>
<i>So when this loose behaviour I throw off,</i>

1327
01:49:42,834 --> 01:49:45,334
<i>偿还从未许诺的债务</i>
<i>and pay the debt I never promised</i>

1328
01:49:53,042 --> 01:49:56,459
<i>我的行动将比誓言更为珍贵</i>
<i>By how much better than my word I am</i>

1329
01:50:46,792 --> 01:50:48,250
对不起
I'm sorry.

1330
01:50:49,959 --> 01:50:51,334
真的很抱歉

1331

我说的话不可原谅
It's unforgivable what I said.

1332
01:50:59,042 --> 01:51:01,000
不可原谅 而且完全不是事实
Unforgivable and entirely untrue.

1333
01:51:09,542 --> 01:51:10,834
我当时喝醉了
I was drunk.

1334
01:51:15,375 --> 01:51:16,417
又喝醉了
Again.

1335
01:51:19,875 --> 01:51:21,292
这不能成为借口
It was no excuse.

1336
01:51:24,959 --> 01:51:26,500
我欠你的
I owe you

1337
01:51:28,834 --> 01:51:30,000
太多太多
everything.

1338
01:51:34,084 --> 01:51:35,810
我从未对你说过
I've never said it to you

1339
01:51:35,834 --> 01:51:37,167
我甚至从未

1341

所以现在我要感谢你 也要向你道歉

1342
01:51:46,167 --> 01:51:47,334
真心实意地
Truly, with all my heart.

1343
01:52:02,292 --> 01:52:03,500
我害怕
I'm afraid.

1344
01:52:06,125 --> 01:52:07,792
我真的害怕
I am I'm afraid.

1345
01:52:09,625 --> 01:52:11,125
我不像你
I'm not like you.

1346
01:52:12,042 --> 01:52:13,667
我就是个该死的冒牌货
I'm just a bloody fake.

1347
01:52:17,584 --> 01:52:18,917
顶多算半个演员
I'm half an actor.

1348
01:52:21,042 --> 01:52:26,560
我善妒 傲慢 自私又刻薄
And I'm jealous and proud
and selfish and spiteful.

1349
01:52:26,584 --> 01:52:29,375
而你拥有一切
And you are everything.

1350
01:52:31,334 --> 01:52:33,417
你很坚强 真的
You're strong Truly, you are.

1351
01:52:34,417 --> 01:52:37,292
这部戏 PH
And this play, PH

1352
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:43,209
这就是我们为之奋斗的一切。
this is everything we worked for.

1353
01:52:44,417 --> 01:52:45,792
而我却感到恐惧。
And I'm terrified.

1354
01:52:49,542 --> 01:52:50,750
我害怕极了。
I'm terrified.

1355
01:53:00,834 --> 01:53:02,209
求你了。
Please.

1356
01:53:03,959 --> 01:53:05,542
帮帮我。
Help me.

1357
01:53:08,625 --> 01:53:10,042
回来吧
Come back

1358
01:53:22,209 --> 01:53:23,417
我必须走了
I have to go

1359
01:54:53,459 --> 01:54:56,917
现在，哈尔，
现在是什么时辰了，小子？
Now, Hal,
what time of day is it, lad?

1360
01:55:06,959 --> 01:55:08,334
汝
Thou

1361
01:55:11,792 --> 01:55:17,250
因痛饮陈年美酒而愚钝至此
art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack

1362
01:55:18,459 --> 01:55:21,060
竟忘却追问那真正
that thou hast forgotten
to demand that truly

1363
01:55:21,084 --> 01:55:23,310
汝心所向之事。
which thou wouldst truly know.

1364
01:55:23,334 --> 01:55:26,310
时辰与你何干？
What a devil hast thou to do
with the time of day?

1365
01:55:26,334 --> 01:55:30,685
除非时光化作美酒盏盏，
分秒变为肥鸡只只，
Unless hours were cups of sack,
and minutes capons,

1366
01:55:30,709 --> 01:55:32,476
而钟表是老鸨的巧舌如簧
and clocks the tongues of bawds

1367
01:55:42,834 --> 01:55:45,351
切莫如此作想；事实绝非这般。
Do not think so; You shall not find it so.

1368
01:55:45,375 --> 01:55:48,101
愿上帝宽恕那些
And God forgive them
that so much have swayed.

1369
01:55:48,125 --> 01:55:49,935
使陛下对我
Your Majesty's good thoughts
away from me.

1370
01:55:49,959 --> 01:55:52,000
我要告诉您：我是您的儿子。
To tell you that I am your son.

1371
01:55:56,959 --> 01:56:00,625
为何王冠搁置于
Why doth the crown lie there
upon his pillow,

1372
01:56:03,125 --> 01:56:06,209
他那令人不安的枕畔？
being so troublesome a bedfellow?

1373
01:56:07,750 --> 01:56:09,792
啊，精雕细琢的烦忧。
Oh, polished perturbation.

1374
01:56:12,042 --> 01:56:13,250
黄金般的忧虑
Golden care

1375
01:56:15,209 --> 01:56:19,060
<i>令睡梦之门</i>
<i>that keep'st the ports
of slumber open wide</i>

1376
01:56:19,084 --> 01:56:21,667
<i>向无数不眠之夜敞开</i>
<i>to many a watchful night.</i>

1377
01:56:24,584 --> 01:56:28,500
吾王，我的朱庇特，
我向您倾诉衷肠。
My King, my Jove,
I speak to thee, my heart.

1378
01:56:31,084 --> 01:56:33,042
我不认得你，老翁。
I know thee not, old man.

1379
01:56:36,542 --> 01:56:37,834
快去做你的祷告吧。
Fa" to thy prayers.

1380
01:56:43,125 --> 01:56:47,584
白发配愚人是何等荒唐。
How ill white hairs
become a fool and a jester.

1381
01:56:54,750 --> 01:56:57,834
我长久以来梦见这般人物。
I have long dreamt of such a kind of man.

1382
01:56:59,917 --> 01:57:01,084
但醒来后，
But being awaked,

1383
01:57:02,584 --> 01:57:05,084
我对梦境嗤之以鼻
I do despise my dream

1384
01:58:16,042 --> 01:58:17,250
太棒了！
Bravo!

1385
01:58:40,042 --> 01:58:42,101
精彩绝伦，谢谢
Wonderful, thank you

1386
01:58:44,125 --> 01:58:46,643
当然
Of course

1387
01:58:49,709 --> 01:58:51,000
里奇。
Richie.

1388
01:58:52,042 --> 01:58:53,834
第五幕，第五场。
Act Five, Scene Five.

1389
01:58:55,917 --> 01:58:58,209
你的声音转换真是。
The modulation of your voice It was.

1390
01:58:59,959 --> 01:59:03,375
你的静默表现确实。
Well, your stillness, it was really.

1391
01:59:08,792 --> 01:59:10,875
呃，我真的。
Uh, I was really.

1392
01:59:12,625 --> 01:59:15,625
我，呃，从未。
Well, I, uh, I have never.

1393
01:59:39,917 --> 01:59:41,084
什么？
What?

1394
01:59:45,084 --> 01:59:47,542
难道儿子不能拥抱
自己的亲生父亲吗？
Can a man not hug
his own bloody father?

1395
02:01:34,209 --> 02:01:38,292
