1
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:07,374
- Here.
- Thanks.

2
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:10,624
- Ready?
- Yep.

3
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:16,957
Look at them.

4
00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:19,457
They don't truly like music.

5
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:21,249
What?

6
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:24,332
Music is stereo, not mono.

7
00:01:25,332 --> 00:01:28,582
Your left and right earphones
play different sounds.

8
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:31,582
They're listening to
two different songs.

9
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:34,957
It's like a BLT.

10
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:39,374
If you eat the bacon and lettuce
separately, is that a BLT?

11
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:40,707
No.

12
00:01:41,332 --> 00:01:45,332
You share a pork cutlet bowl
and one person eats all the pork.

13
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:46,957
The other person had?

14
00:01:47,832 --> 00:01:49,249
- Egg and rice.
- See?

15
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:52,124
Whatever that couple
thinks they're doing,

16
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:54,416
they aren't listening
to the same music.

17
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:59,541
You know those mixing consoles
they have in recording studios?

18
00:01:59,624 --> 00:02:00,499
Yeah.

19
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:03,207
They have all those knobs and buttons.

20
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:07,332
All of them exist to make the sound
more three-dimensional.

21
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:11,416
Musicians and audio engineers
all work into the dead of night

22
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:15,374
eating takeout as they try to get
the sound just right.

23
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:19,207
And to think someone would
listen to left and right separately...

24
00:02:19,374 --> 00:02:23,082
the sound mixer would throw
their takeout onto the console.

25
00:02:23,332 --> 00:02:24,624
Like, "Screw it!"

26
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:27,082
Maybe they want to listen together.

27
00:02:28,332 --> 00:02:30,707
Everyone has their own phone.

28
00:02:30,957 --> 00:02:34,957
You could wear separate earphones
and press play at the same time.

29
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:38,832
Isn't sharing one thing the point?

30
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:40,832
You can't share it.

31
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:42,082
Love, that is.

32
00:02:42,207 --> 00:02:43,999
Each person has their own love.

33
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:45,582
It's one person each.

34
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,749
Those two don't get that.

35
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:51,249
I should tell them.

36
00:03:05,207 --> 00:03:06,582
- Change of mind?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:11,832
By the way, did I leave my earrings
at your place last night, Mugi?

38
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:13,249
I don't think so...

39
00:03:13,332 --> 00:03:16,999
My parents have been asking,
"When are we going to meet Kinu?"

40
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:18,582
What do you say?

41
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:21,832
Right. Better figure out a date...

42
00:03:21,957 --> 00:03:24,124
Maybe the sink or the bathtub?

43
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:25,249
Yeah...

00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:35,874
Take the back seat.

149
00:11:42,582 --> 00:11:45,332
<font color="#FFFF00">Mom: Can you pick up
some toilet paper?</font>

150
00:11:50,332 --> 00:11:54,332
- Crap, the last train's leaving.
- Come on, we'd better hurry.

151
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:57,707
It's leaving any minute.

152
00:11:58,457 --> 00:12:00,832
- Tomorrow's work.
- I have something, too.

153
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:11,332
Pardon me. Sorry.

154
00:12:11,957 --> 00:12:13,207
Here. Go ahead.

155
00:12:13,374 --> 00:12:14,374
Thank you.

156
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:18,707
I need to charge?

157
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:20,874
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Insufficient funds.</i></font>

158
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:28,332
Crap...

159
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:32,457
Did we miss it?

160
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:34,957
Looks like it.

161
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:39,457
Next train's at dawn...

162
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:49,332
Do you know any 24-hour bars?

163
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:50,582
Sorry?

164
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:53,249
Coming?

165
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:54,874
Sure.

166
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:08,207
Thank you.

167
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,082
Do you have work tomorrow?

168
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:15,999
Not until the afternoon.

169
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,166
- Where do you work?
- In publishing.

170
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:23,874
Publishing? How impressive.

171
00:13:24,332 --> 00:13:26,624
It's only a small company.

172
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:28,832
And you?

173
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:30,999
I have tomorrow off.

174
00:13:31,082 --> 00:13:32,457
Nice. Any plans?

175
00:13:32,582 --> 00:13:34,582
Not quite sure yet.

176
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:41,957
Don't look.

177
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:43,624
What's up?

178
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:47,957
We have a legend in our midst.

179
00:13:56,707 --> 00:13:57,707
A legend?

180
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:03,374
He's that dog lover
and soba noodle connoisseur.

181
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:05,249
Is he famous?

182
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:06,624
What?

183
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:09,582
Don't you watch movies?

184
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:13,166
Of course I do.
People say my taste is pretty obscure.

185
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:14,457
Like what?

186
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:16,374
Like <i><font color="#80FFFF">The Shawshank Redemption.</i></font>

187
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:18,666
- I've heard of that.
- It's so moving.

188
00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:20,207
Is it, really?

189
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:23,999
Last year, I watched
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Kiki's Delivery Service.</i></font>

190
00:14:24,082 --> 00:14:24,999
Just last year?

191
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:26,624
- With that kid actor?
- Right.

192
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,041
- The live action one?
- I did, too.

193
00:14:29,124 --> 00:14:33,832
<i><font color="#80FFFF">How could they be talking about this
in front of the legend himself?</i></font>

194
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:39,082
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I guess it's people like them who are
responsible for all those remakes.</i></font>

195
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:44,666
- We're off.
- See you.

196
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:46,832
- Good night.
- Good night.

197
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:48,957
Good night.

198
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:06,707
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I thought I owed it to him
to say something.</i></font>

199
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:12,082
<i><font color="#80FFFF">In truth, I was just as excited
as he was.</i></font>

200
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:16,832
Can't believe we saw Oshii.

201
00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:20,457
Mamoru Oshii was in that bar.

202
00:15:21,457 --> 00:15:22,541
You know him?

203
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:27,957
Whether you like him or not,
everyone should at least know him.

204
00:15:29,874 --> 00:15:32,457
Indeed. He's world-class.

205
00:15:33,957 --> 00:15:34,666
Indeed.

206
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:37,582
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It all started with Mamoru Oshii.</i></font>

207
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:40,374
- Also...
- The hand cream?

208
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:42,999
Right. She put on all that hand cream.

209
00:15:43,082 --> 00:15:44,499
Only to use a hand towel.

210
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:46,082
Right? I was so confused...

211
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:48,957
Ouch. Something stabbed me.

212
00:15:49,957 --> 00:15:52,124
You live near Tobitakyu Station?

213
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:55,957
Yes. I always transfer
at Chofu Station.

214
00:15:56,082 --> 00:15:59,332
We might've passed each other
at the station then.

215
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:01,249
That's true.

216
00:16:01,582 --> 00:16:02,749
Oh, thanks.

217
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,749
Here you go. Two highballs.

218
00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:18,374
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

219
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:19,457
Enjoy.

220
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:24,957
I'm Kinu Hachiya.

221
00:16:26,457 --> 00:16:28,707
My favorite phrase is
"Free noodle refills."

222
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:31,874
I'm Mugi Yamane.

223
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:35,249
My favorite phrase is

224
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:38,499
"A crowbar-like object."

225
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:50,582
That hits the spot.

226
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:55,207
Notice how earphones always
end up like this?

227
00:16:56,707 --> 00:16:59,666
- Me, too. See?
- They get all tangled up...

228
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:00,832
Right?

229
00:17:12,874 --> 00:17:15,207
I've read most of
Hiroshi Homura's work.

230
00:17:16,249 --> 00:17:18,957
I've read most of Yu Nagashima's work.

231
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:22,124
Although, I usually have to
wait for paperback.

232
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:23,957
I use the library.

233
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:26,082
Who else do you read?

234
00:17:26,832 --> 00:17:27,999
- Shinji Ishii.
- Yes.

235
00:17:28,082 --> 00:17:29,624
- Toshiyuki Horie.
- Yes.

236
00:17:29,707 --> 00:17:31,082
Tomoka Shibasaki.

237
00:17:31,957 --> 00:17:34,374
Hiroko Oyamada. Natsuko Imamura.

238
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:38,207
Of course, Yoko Ogawa and Yoko Tawada.

239
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:41,332
Also, Otaro Maijo and Aki Sato.

240
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:46,582
You, too?

241
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:48,999
You, too?

242
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:52,166
You use movie tickets
as bookmarks?

243
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:54,207
I do, indeed.

244
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:01,082
You know that bar cero's Takagi runs?

245
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:03,207
Roji? I've been there.

246
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,582
My friend met Takagi in person
and became a cero fan.

247
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:10,082
She pawned off all her
collectible Yuzu gift cards.

248
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:16,249
There was this show Tenjiku Nezumi
did at the Lumine theater.

249
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:17,457
Yes, I'm aware.

250
00:18:17,957 --> 00:18:20,707
I had a ticket but I couldn't go.

251
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:21,999
Me, too.

252
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:29,749
I accidentally missed it.

253
00:18:33,957 --> 00:18:34,957
Really?

254
00:18:35,957 --> 00:18:37,832
You weren't kidding.

255
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:42,332
We might've met at the show
if we had gone.

256
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,707
You're right.

257
00:18:46,374 --> 00:18:47,832
Interesting...

258
00:18:48,957 --> 00:18:51,832
But if we had gone to the show,

259
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:54,707
we might not have met today.

260
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:56,207
Maybe so.

261
00:18:56,832 --> 00:19:00,124
So these were our tickets
to meet each other today.

262
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:01,957
I see.

263
00:19:13,624 --> 00:19:16,374
Do you listen to Ikina Yoru Denpa?

264
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:18,999
Naruyoshi Kikuchi's radio show?

265
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:20,707
Yes, of course.

266
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:22,624
Sorry, I cut you off.

267
00:19:22,707 --> 00:19:24,582
I'm going to use the restroom.

268
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:26,916
It's to the right of the entrance.

269
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,457
Okay. Thanks.

270
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:39,582
I used to be really into gas holders.

271
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:41,374
Takashimadaira has good ones.

272
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:46,457
Also, Roka-koen, Chitose-karasuyama,
Minami-senju among other spots.

273
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:47,916
Interesting.

274
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:51,332
I used to take videos of them, too.

275
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:54,582
I edited them and all.

276
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:56,457
You made a movie?

277
00:19:56,582 --> 00:19:58,124
- No...
- I want to see.

278
00:19:58,207 --> 00:19:59,207
Seriously?

279
00:19:59,457 --> 00:20:01,749
It's 3 hours 21 minutes long.

280
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:05,249
That's like <i><font color="#80FFFF">The Return of the King</i></font>
but only with gas holders.

281
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:08,082
I know. It interests me
much more than <i><font color="#80FFFF">The Hobbit.</i></font>

282
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,082
Really? Want to go watch it now?

283
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:11,832
Sure, I'd love to.

284
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:20,082
Go ahead.

285
00:20:27,707 --> 00:20:30,749
There you are, Mugi.

286
00:20:31,457 --> 00:20:33,707
Why are you here?

287
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:35,332
Why?

288
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:38,582
I went to the karaoke bar,

289
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:42,374
but they said you weren't coming
because the moon was unlucky.

290
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:44,499
What's that supposed to mean?

291
00:20:44,624 --> 00:20:47,124
Someone was pulling your chain.

292
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:48,499
What?

293
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,207
Are you with someone?

294
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:52,457
Yeah.

295
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:54,207
Drink with us. Right, everyone?

296
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:56,749
- Sure.
- Drink with us.

297
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,499
What's an "unlucky moon" anyway?

298
00:21:00,582 --> 00:21:02,457
Who knows?

299
00:21:02,832 --> 00:21:04,249
Weird, huh?

300
00:21:04,457 --> 00:21:06,999
Give me a minute, okay?

301
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:09,832
My friend says I can
stay over at her place.

302
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:22,624
Sorry, I'd better go now.

303
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,332
Bye.

304
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:32,999
- Bye.
- See you.

305
00:21:36,957 --> 00:21:38,082
Hey, Mugi?

306
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:40,332
Yes?

307
00:21:40,374 --> 00:21:44,207
I was hoping for a chance
to talk one-on-one with you.

308
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:56,332
Excuse me.

309
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,082
I...

310
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:00,957
Excuse me, I...

311
00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:02,749
You need more money?

312
00:22:02,832 --> 00:22:03,832
What?

313
00:22:08,124 --> 00:22:10,082
I was going this way anyway.

314
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:13,749
My friend's apartment is nearby.

315
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,416
That's a lie.

316
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:16,666
Seriously? Let go.

317
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:19,582
- Come on.
- I insist.

318
00:22:31,957 --> 00:22:33,582
Can I ask you a favor?

319
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:38,707
I want to go to a karaoke bar
that actually looks like one.

320
00:22:41,749 --> 00:22:47,499
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Bought those 350 ml cans
of beer at the convenience store</i></font>

321
00:22:47,582 --> 00:22:49,749
<i><font color="#80FFFF">A night walk just you and me</i></font>

322
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:52,624
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The clock says its midnight</i></font>

323
00:22:52,957 --> 00:22:55,499
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Ever heard of chronostasis?</i></font>

324
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,499
<i><font color="#80FFFF">You said, never heard of it</i></font>

325
00:22:58,582 --> 00:23:01,166
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It's when the clock
seems like it's stopped</i></font>

326
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:04,124
<i><font color="#80FFFF">You know that feeling?</i></font>

327
00:23:08,457 --> 00:23:10,707
Ever heard of chronostasis?

328
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:12,457
Never heard of it.

329
00:23:12,707 --> 00:23:16,874
It's when you look at the clock
and think, "Hey, that's my birthday."

330
00:23:16,957 --> 00:23:19,874
You know that feeling?

331
00:23:19,957 --> 00:23:22,707
- Awesome. Cheers.
- Cheers.

332
00:23:28,332 --> 00:23:30,582
Let me see...

333
00:23:31,082 --> 00:23:32,749
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Amiko Here</i></font> was pretty good.

334
00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:34,082
"Picnic," right?

335
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,499
That one blew me away.

336
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,999
Right?

337
00:23:38,957 --> 00:23:42,499
Imamura hasn't written
anything since, has she?

338
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:45,707
Yeah. I hope she does soon.

339
00:23:46,707 --> 00:23:51,624
The other day, I was being swayed by
a train when the person next to me...

340
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:54,957
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Where other people would say,
"I was riding the train,"</i></font>

341
00:23:55,624 --> 00:23:58,874
<i><font color="#80FFFF">he said, "I was
being swayed by a train."</i></font>

342
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:03,291
Let me ask you.

343
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:07,707
There's something I never understood
ever since I was a kid.

344
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:12,582
So there's rock, paper,
and scissors, right?

345
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:13,999
Right.

346
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:17,249
How on earth does paper beat rock?

347
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:18,749
It'll rip.

348
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:23,332
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I know someone who's been
wondering that for years.</i></font>

349
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,332
Nearly there.

350
00:24:28,582 --> 00:24:29,957
Nearly there.

351
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:31,624
Nearly there.

352
00:24:31,957 --> 00:24:33,332
Nearly there.

353
00:24:33,832 --> 00:24:34,832
Nearly there.

354
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:36,332
We made it.

355
00:24:36,457 --> 00:24:37,791
Finally.

356
00:24:37,874 --> 00:24:39,249
We made it to Chofu.

357
00:24:39,332 --> 00:24:41,582
- Hooray.
- Hooray.

358
00:24:45,457 --> 00:24:46,582
Puddle!

359
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:49,582
Oh, man. I fully stepped in it.

360
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:53,666
This is my place.
Sorry to make you run.

361
00:24:53,749 --> 00:24:55,832
It's totally fine.

362
00:24:57,707 --> 00:24:58,874
It's freezing.

363
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,582
Come in.

364
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:07,499
Excuse me.

365
00:25:07,582 --> 00:25:10,207
- Come in. Sorry it's messy.
- Not at all.

366
00:25:10,374 --> 00:25:11,749
Can I put this here?

367
00:25:11,832 --> 00:25:15,082
Sure. Why don't we just
set it all down here?

368
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:16,207
Okay.

369
00:25:16,874 --> 00:25:18,124
Wow...

370
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:20,332
Crazy how hard it rained.

371
00:25:21,207 --> 00:25:22,457
I kind of enjoyed it.

372
00:25:23,707 --> 00:25:25,249
Let me get you a towel.

373
00:25:25,374 --> 00:25:26,624
Thanks.

374
00:25:26,832 --> 00:25:28,957
- Make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

375
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:54,999
Here you go.

376
00:25:56,207 --> 00:25:58,082
We have identical bookshelves.

377
00:26:02,124 --> 00:26:07,666
<i><font color="#80FFFF">After that, we watched my gas holder
movie, which I had never shown anyone.</i></font>

378
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:08,957
It's Takashimadaira.

379
00:26:11,874 --> 00:26:15,124
<i><font color="#80FFFF">We got hungry, so I made us
some grilled rice balls.</i></font>

380
00:26:20,332 --> 00:26:21,624
Can I have another?

381
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:23,249
Sorry?

382
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,332
Can I have it?

383
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,499
Go ahead.

384
00:26:25,749 --> 00:26:28,207
<i><font color="#80FFFF">She had two of them.</i></font>

385
00:26:29,332 --> 00:26:30,332
They're tasty.

386
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:33,374
Five-minute nap, okay?

387
00:26:33,832 --> 00:26:36,499
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And fell asleep at the best part.</i></font>

388
00:26:39,457 --> 00:26:44,457
<i><font color="#80FFFF">An hour later, she got up and said,
"Cool movie. Guess I'll head home."</i></font>

389
00:26:46,624 --> 00:26:48,499
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I was sure I'd turned her off.</i></font>

390
00:26:55,707 --> 00:26:58,249
Hold the bus. Hold up, please.

391
00:26:58,374 --> 00:27:00,207
- Sorry.
- Made it.

392
00:27:02,749 --> 00:27:04,999
- Hey. There's...
- Yes?

393
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,207
There's a mummy exhibit
at the National Museum.

394
00:27:09,249 --> 00:27:11,457
I thought maybe you'd like to...

395
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:13,874
I'd love to.

396
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:15,207
Welcome home.

397
00:28:17,082 --> 00:28:19,791
Dear, Kinu's been out all night again.

398
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:21,082
<i><font color="#80FFFF">What a waste.</i></font>

399
00:28:21,457 --> 00:28:24,999
Do you know what time it is?
Where have you been?

400
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:26,874
<i><font color="#80FFFF">What a terrible waste.</i></font>

401
00:28:30,707 --> 00:28:34,457
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Don't talk to me yet,
you'll ruin the moment.</i></font>

402
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:40,332
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I still want to bask
in the afterglow of last night.</i></font>

403
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:45,999
<i><font color="#80FFFF">If only there were
music for times like these.</i></font>

404
00:28:52,332 --> 00:28:55,624
<i><font color="#80FFFF">His apartment was eight minutes away
from Chofu Station.</i></font>

405
00:28:56,207 --> 00:29:00,582
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It was filled with guidebooks for
places he had no plans to visit.</i></font>

406
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:02,874
We have identical bookshelves.

407
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:10,999
That's private...

408
00:29:11,957 --> 00:29:13,582
Did you do these?

409
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:16,374
Yeah...

410
00:29:18,374 --> 00:29:21,582
I was hoping to turn it into a career.

411
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:26,957
That was a joke. You get it?

412
00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:31,124
I like your art.

413
00:29:39,624 --> 00:29:44,457
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Thin strands of rain came down,
illuminated by the orange streetlamp.</i></font>

<i><font color="#80FFFF">Listening to the rain,

<i><font color="#80FFFF">when he said very shyly.</i></font>

416
00:29:53,457 --> 00:29:54,707
You'll catch a cold.

417
00:29:55,082 --> 00:29:58,582
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And brought a hairdryer
from his bathroom.</i></font>

418
00:30:00,707 --> 00:30:02,582
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The cord was just long enough,</i></font>

419

<i><font color="#80FFFF">and he started drying my hair.</i></font>

<i><font color="#80FFFF">My heart started pounding

<i><font color="#80FFFF">the hairdryer drowned it out.</i></font>

422

<i><font color="#80FFFF">She said she liked my art.</i></font>

<font color="#FFFF00">Mummy exhibit</font>

431
00:31:00,457 --> 00:31:01,457
Okay, then.

432
00:31:02,207 --> 00:31:03,207
Shall we?

433
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:19,582
Wasn't it incredible?

434
00:31:19,832 --> 00:31:23,582
Yes. It was beyond words.

435
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:24,957
Look at this one.

436
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:27,707
Ready to order?

437
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:32,499
Let's see...

438
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:34,582
All you can drink.

439
00:31:34,707 --> 00:31:35,707
Certainly.

440
00:31:35,832 --> 00:31:38,707
There's this man who lives
in the house next to us.

441
00:31:39,957 --> 00:31:42,832
He looks just like Ryu Murakami.

442
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:46,957
And his wife is a dead ringer
for Eiko Koike.

443
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:50,291
Like the TV show Cambrian Palace!

444
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:51,999
Right?

445
00:31:52,457 --> 00:31:54,249
I've got to see this.

446
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,332
That's a miracle.

447
00:31:58,332 --> 00:31:59,457
It's unbelievable.

448
00:32:01,707 --> 00:32:04,707
It's getting pretty late.
Should we head home?

449
00:32:05,082 --> 00:32:06,749
I guess so.

450
00:32:06,832 --> 00:32:07,957
Let's go.

451
00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:10,957
Cambrian Palace, that's funny...

452
00:32:11,957 --> 00:32:14,832
Oh, have you read <i><font color="#80FFFF">Golden Kamuy</i></font>?

453
00:32:14,957 --> 00:32:16,124
Yes. It's so intense.

<i><font color="#80FFFF">We ended up talking about

471
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:20,874
This is quite...

472
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:26,457
Wow, I must say,
this has exceeded my expectations.

473
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:29,082
I underestimated it.

474
00:33:31,874 --> 00:33:33,707
"Girl meets gas holder."

475
00:33:36,207 --> 00:33:37,249
Nice.

476
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:39,749
I got a great picture.

477
00:33:39,832 --> 00:33:41,082
Really?

478
00:33:43,749 --> 00:33:46,332
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Eight hours until the last train.</i></font>

480
00:33:50,582 --> 00:33:53,416
The movie lineup looks promising.

481
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:54,499
Indeed.

482
00:33:54,707 --> 00:33:56,749
Shimotakaido Cinema, too.

483
00:33:57,082 --> 00:33:58,332
Of course.

484
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:03,707
<i><font color="#80FFFF">We always talk about stuff like that.</i></font>

486
00:34:07,082 --> 00:34:08,957
So when it comes to bread,

487
00:34:09,749 --> 00:34:12,332
are you a five-slice
or six-slice person?

You're right. It's you.

491
00:34:24,374 --> 00:34:25,957
You're in a band?

492
00:34:26,082 --> 00:34:28,457
We're just starting out, though.

493
00:34:30,332 --> 00:34:31,749
"Awesome City Club"?

494
00:34:32,082 --> 00:34:34,332
Yes. Give us a search on YouTube.

495
00:34:34,707 --> 00:34:36,124
Definitely.

496
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:37,957
So...

497
00:34:38,124 --> 00:34:41,707
do you guys have any
romantic-type songs?

498
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:43,624
Basically, a love song.

499
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:44,832
We do.

500
00:35:00,124 --> 00:35:01,541
Cool intro.

501
00:35:01,624 --> 00:35:02,624
Yeah.

502
00:35:03,207 --> 00:35:04,457
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I've got this.</i></font>

503

<i><font color="#80FFFF">One hour to go.</i></font>

504
00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:12,374
You guys.

505
00:35:14,374 --> 00:35:15,499
You're no music fans.

506
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:21,707
Left and right earphones
play different sounds.

507
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:26,082
Sorry, you see...

508
00:35:27,332 --> 00:35:31,707
The way sound mixing works is...

509
00:35:31,832 --> 00:35:33,457
<i><font color="#80FFFF">For the next hour or so,</i></font>

510
00:35:33,749 --> 00:35:37,207
<i><font color="#80FFFF">he lectured us on the mixing
techniques of an audio engineer.</i></font>

511
00:35:37,832 --> 00:35:41,457
That can have a dramatic effect
on how you experience the song.

512
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:50,582
The last train's about to leave.

513
00:35:52,207 --> 00:35:53,374
I suppose so.

514
00:35:57,707 --> 00:36:00,582
Here you go. One chocolate sundae.

515
00:36:01,957 --> 00:36:03,832
We didn't order this.

516
00:36:04,332 --> 00:36:05,249
Really?

517
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:06,332
Yes.

518
00:36:09,207 --> 00:36:10,207
Oh, dear.

519
00:36:11,332 --> 00:36:13,999
Sorry. We punched in the order wrong.

520
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:18,082
It's okay. We can, you know...

521
00:36:19,207 --> 00:36:21,332
- We'll have it.
- Yes.

522
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:24,874
Thank you very much.

523
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:28,082
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

524
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:30,874
Looks delicious.

525
00:36:31,457 --> 00:36:32,624
It really does.

526
00:36:33,582 --> 00:36:34,832
It's not small.

527
00:36:35,957 --> 00:36:36,957
True.

528
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:42,999
Miss Hachiya.

529
00:36:45,957 --> 00:36:46,957
Yes?

530
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,374
Will you be my girlfriend?

531
00:37:00,499 --> 00:37:01,499
Yes.

532
00:37:02,457 --> 00:37:03,457
I'd love that.

533
00:37:22,499 --> 00:37:25,707
White jeans are a turnoff for me.

534
00:37:26,707 --> 00:37:27,707
Okay.

535
00:37:27,832 --> 00:37:30,374
If the person I was dating
wore white jeans,

536
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,874
I'd like them a little less.

537
00:37:34,832 --> 00:37:35,957
Understood.

538
00:37:36,832 --> 00:37:39,374
I promise not to wear white jeans.

539
00:37:41,124 --> 00:37:44,249
Is there something on your end?

540
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:49,582
In the game Uno.

541
00:37:50,749 --> 00:37:51,666
Uno?

542
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:55,624
"You forgot to say uno, draw two!"
People who say that.

543
00:37:56,749 --> 00:37:57,874
That turns me off.

544
00:37:58,499 --> 00:38:00,207
Okay. Understood.

545
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:02,457
I'll never say that.

546
00:38:05,332 --> 00:38:06,374
That's all.

547
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:11,082
Alright.

548
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,082
Good night.

549
00:38:14,707 --> 00:38:15,957
Good night.

550
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,874

<i><font color="#80FFFF">Thank goodness for push buttons.</i></font>

555
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:25,457
One more thing.

556
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:30,082
I rather like frequent
displays of affection like this.

557
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:35,874
Okay.

Wait. What are you doing?

568
00:40:53,499 --> 00:40:55,374
- It's okay.
- What are you doing?

569

It's okay. Just relax.

00:44:42,207 --> 00:44:43,332
Smells great, huh?

616
00:44:43,457 --> 00:44:44,957
Thanks.

617
00:44:48,832 --> 00:44:52,082
I see this flower all the time.
What's it called?

618
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:53,874
Ma...

619
00:44:57,957 --> 00:45:00,332
Apparently, when you ask a girl that,

620
00:45:00,874 --> 00:45:05,624
the flower reminds you of that girl
for the rest of your life.

622
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:09,874
Is that true?

623
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,707
Tell me, then.

624
00:45:12,332 --> 00:45:14,332
I wonder if I should.

625
00:45:14,582 --> 00:45:17,041
Come on, tell me.

626
00:45:17,124 --> 00:45:18,624
What comes after "ma"?

627
00:45:18,707 --> 00:45:20,707
Take a guess. Want this topping?

628
00:45:20,832 --> 00:45:22,207
Sure. So it's "ma"...?

629

630
00:45:28,374 --> 00:45:30,999
This one is a mountain stream.

631
00:45:31,207 --> 00:45:35,082
I shot a mountain stream,
turned it vertically,

632
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:37,207
and changed the shutter speed.

633
00:45:37,332 --> 00:45:40,207
How impressive is that?

634
00:45:40,457 --> 00:45:42,374
Mugi. Over here.

635
00:45:42,457 --> 00:45:43,832
Hey, Mugi!

636
00:45:43,957 --> 00:45:45,791
- It's been a while.
- Indeed.

637
00:45:45,874 --> 00:45:47,707
- You doing well?
- Yes.

638
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:51,124
- This is Kinu.
- Hello.

639
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:52,499
Hey.

640
00:45:52,582 --> 00:45:54,832
So are you guys like...

641
00:45:56,957 --> 00:45:58,082
She's my girlfriend.

642
00:45:58,832 --> 00:45:59,874
Seriously?

643
00:46:01,082 --> 00:46:02,124
Like the work?

644
00:46:02,249 --> 00:46:03,499
It's brilliant.

645
00:46:03,582 --> 00:46:04,707
Right?

646
00:46:07,457 --> 00:46:11,499
I bet you're wondering what's up
with the matching fedoras.

647
00:46:11,707 --> 00:46:12,457
Kind of.

648
00:46:12,707 --> 00:46:14,124
The more pretentious...

649
00:46:14,207 --> 00:46:15,749
the bigger the hat?

650
00:46:17,832 --> 00:46:19,624
Precisely.

651
00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:21,249
Hey, Mugi.

652
00:46:21,332 --> 00:46:22,707
I like her.

653
00:46:22,832 --> 00:46:25,707
Who'd have thought
you'd get a girl like her, right?

654
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:28,124
Hey, Kaito. Take their picture.

655
00:46:28,207 --> 00:46:29,207
Good idea.

656
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:36,457
- Ready? Good looking couple.
- So true.

657
00:46:36,832 --> 00:46:41,332
How much faith would it take
to get matching tattoos?

658
00:46:42,707 --> 00:46:45,374
Don't you have as much faith in us?

659
00:46:48,582 --> 00:46:50,832
Who knows? You might cheat on me.

660
00:46:51,457 --> 00:46:52,457
What?

Kinu?

665

Me? Just working.

672
00:48:07,457 --> 00:48:11,707
For my portfolio. So Kaito can
introduce me to that publisher.

673
00:48:13,374 --> 00:48:14,499
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I see.</i></font>

Yeah.

<i><font color="#80FFFF">Keep at it.</i></font>

676
00:48:19,082 --> 00:48:20,082
I will.

677
00:48:21,374 --> 00:48:22,374
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Okay, then.</i></font>

678

Good night.

00:48:27,749 --> 00:48:30,457
Hold on, Kinu. Don't hang up.

681
00:48:35,582 --> 00:48:38,832
Are you crying?

682
00:49:01,332 --> 00:49:02,999
You went out wearing that?

683

684
00:49:24,332 --> 00:49:27,374
The system we have
in this country is insanity.

685
00:49:28,374 --> 00:49:30,207
Why are you the one fired up?

686
00:49:30,832 --> 00:49:33,124
It's my fault. I'm just too weak.

687
00:49:33,249 --> 00:49:36,457
That's not true.
It's that interviewer.

688
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:38,207
He's an important man.

689
00:49:38,332 --> 00:49:40,207
That may well be true,

690
00:49:40,832 --> 00:49:45,082
but he's the kind of man who'd feel
nothing reading Imamura's "Picnic."

691
00:49:46,082 --> 00:49:48,874
None of that matters in job hunting.

692
00:49:49,582 --> 00:49:51,541
Why don't you just quit?

693
00:49:51,624 --> 00:49:53,582
It's not even what you want.

694
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:55,582
My parents nag me at home.

695
00:49:55,832 --> 00:49:56,999
Thanks for the food.

696
00:49:57,874 --> 00:50:01,749
To them, you might as well be
a thug if you don't join a company.

697
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,624
Just live here, then.

698
00:50:05,332 --> 00:50:06,332
I wish.

699
00:50:08,207 --> 00:50:09,374
Move in with me.

700
00:50:20,457 --> 00:50:22,207
Kinu!

701
00:50:27,707 --> 00:50:29,207
Right?

702
00:50:31,332 --> 00:50:33,332
- What a view.
- Amazing.

703
00:50:33,957 --> 00:50:36,832
We'll redo the floor here.

704
00:50:37,249 --> 00:50:39,416
Remember, the station
is 30 minutes away.

705
00:50:39,499 --> 00:50:41,624
Maybe set up a table here.

706
00:50:41,707 --> 00:50:42,541
Good idea.

707
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:43,832
- You sure?
- Or here.

708
00:50:47,582 --> 00:50:48,832
Ready, go.

709
00:50:51,832 --> 00:50:53,249
Careful...

710
00:50:53,499 --> 00:50:55,582
- Slowly does it.
- We're clear.

711

712

- Do it.

713
00:51:04,124 --> 00:51:06,749

- Success.

773
00:56:31,082 --> 00:56:32,082
Welcome home.

774
00:56:32,207 --> 00:56:33,332
I'm back.

775
00:56:33,457 --> 00:56:35,832
Bad news, my parents
are coming tomorrow.

776
00:56:35,957 --> 00:56:36,957
What?

777
00:56:37,207 --> 00:56:38,249
Watch out, okay?

778
00:56:38,624 --> 00:56:43,707
They're like two walking ad agencies,
coaxing you with catchy life lessons.

779
00:56:46,874 --> 00:56:51,374
Entering the workforce
is like jumping in a bath, you see?

780
00:56:51,707 --> 00:56:53,749
Could you save the pitch for later?

781
00:56:54,624 --> 00:56:56,957
Not a ONE OK ROCK fan?

782
00:56:57,207 --> 00:56:58,999
Oh, they're pretty good.

783
00:57:00,082 --> 00:57:03,124
Why don't you two go see them?
I'll get you tickets.

784
00:57:03,624 --> 00:57:05,457
What do you say?

785
00:57:05,582 --> 00:57:09,416
I'm not saying you have to work
for a major company.

786
00:57:09,499 --> 00:57:11,957
Just a regular company is fine.

787
00:57:12,957 --> 00:57:14,957
I'm working toward the Olympics.

788
00:57:15,207 --> 00:57:16,041
Are you?

789
00:57:16,124 --> 00:57:18,999
It's athletes that compete,
not ad agencies.

790
00:57:20,582 --> 00:57:24,957
Entering the workforce
is like jumping in a bath, okay?

791
00:57:25,582 --> 00:57:27,582
It's a chore to go in at first,

792
00:57:27,707 --> 00:57:31,874
but once you get in,
you're so glad you did.

793
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:34,332
Excellent point.

794
00:57:37,082 --> 00:57:39,457
Don't get drawn in by her ad pitch.

795
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:44,124
Life is about responsibility,
you know?

796
00:57:48,457 --> 00:57:49,749
It's from Hiro.

797
00:57:51,582 --> 00:57:53,457
Hello? This is Hachiya.

798
00:57:53,582 --> 00:57:55,457
Thanks so much for calling.

799

801
00:58:01,332 --> 00:58:05,082
You're a man of Nagaoka.

802
00:58:06,124 --> 00:58:08,457
Firework making is your destiny.

803
00:58:09,207 --> 00:58:10,874
Don't be unreasonable.

804
00:58:12,457 --> 00:58:15,707
Tokyo's fireworks are so unimpressive.

805
00:58:17,582 --> 00:58:19,332
It's time to move back home.

806
00:58:20,124 --> 00:58:21,874
There's something else for me.

807
00:58:29,957 --> 00:58:32,749
In that case,
we'll stop sending you money.

808
00:58:34,499 --> 00:58:38,457
More money for the fireworks fund.

809
00:58:45,332 --> 00:58:48,082
<i><font color="#80FFFF">With my 50,000-yen allowance

811
00:58:58,874 --> 00:59:00,999
Good. Now lower the angle a bit.

812
00:59:01,582 --> 00:59:02,832
Good. Keep it there.

813
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:05,749
Now lose the left one.

814
00:59:14,749 --> 00:59:16,707
So where's Nana?

815
00:59:17,207 --> 00:59:18,207
In Ginza.

816
00:59:18,374 --> 00:59:20,582
She's good at hustling old dudes.

817
00:59:22,582 --> 00:59:23,999
It's just temporary.

818
00:59:24,582 --> 00:59:26,957
This content creator Okawa
is mentoring me.

819
00:59:27,082 --> 00:59:29,582
We'll have more money
once I land an ad gig.

820
00:59:33,499 --> 00:59:34,499
Mugi.

821
00:59:35,457 --> 00:59:36,624
How's work going?

822
00:59:37,957 --> 00:59:39,582
My rate went down recently.

823
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:44,707
I'm sure Nana can get Kinu a club gig.

824
00:59:46,582 --> 00:59:47,707
Stay strong.

825
00:59:48,207 --> 00:59:51,082
Conformity and obedience kill talent.

826
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:10,082
<font color="#FFFF00">Hi, we have three spots

Thanks anyway.</font>

829
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,999
All done.

830
01:00:47,082 --> 01:00:48,374
Thanks.

831
01:00:48,499 --> 01:00:49,749
Hey, Kinu?

832
01:00:50,582 --> 01:00:51,832
I thought I'd get a job.

833
01:00:52,499 --> 01:00:53,499
What?

834
01:00:54,082 --> 01:00:56,874
It's a little late,
but I'll start interviewing.

835
01:00:58,707 --> 01:00:59,707
And illustration?

836
01:01:00,332 --> 01:01:02,332
I can do it on the side.

837
01:01:02,582 --> 01:01:06,874
Once it takes off a little,
I can pivot back.

838
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:10,832
Is this about my mom?

839
01:01:11,082 --> 01:01:12,332
Not at all.

840
01:01:12,707 --> 01:01:16,957
Imamura came back after
a long break, didn't she?

841
01:01:17,082 --> 01:01:18,499
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Ahiru</i></font> was great, right?

842
01:01:19,582 --> 01:01:23,082
PORIN from the diner, too.
You see how great she's doing?

843
01:01:26,207 --> 01:01:30,457
I thought it was time for me
to take the next step, too.

844
01:01:34,207 --> 01:01:35,207
You disapprove?

845
01:01:35,499 --> 01:01:38,207
No. It's not like that.

846
01:01:39,457 --> 01:01:42,499
I just thought things would
always be like this for us.

847
01:01:42,582 --> 01:01:44,207
They will be.

848
01:01:44,374 --> 01:01:47,749
I'm just getting a job.
That's all that's changing.

849
01:01:48,082 --> 01:01:52,249
Without money, we can't buy books
or watch movies, can we?

850
01:01:53,499 --> 01:01:54,499
I guess.

851
01:01:57,332 --> 01:01:59,332
I'm going to get a job.

852
01:02:05,499 --> 01:02:06,707
Good luck.

853
01:02:08,582 --> 01:02:09,832

The best part is
I'm always off by five.

Yep.

01:06:56,707 --> 01:06:58,457
No good. I have a work party.

923
01:07:00,332 --> 01:07:03,374
Oh well, we can go to
the movies any time.

924
01:07:03,999 --> 01:07:05,082
Sorry.

925
01:07:05,832 --> 01:07:07,582
Crap, that reminds me...

926
01:07:08,749 --> 01:07:11,374
- Are those potatoes?
- Yeah. They're good.

927
01:07:12,082 --> 01:07:14,749
- You're right. They're good.
- So delicious.

928
01:07:15,957 --> 01:07:19,582
Hey, Nana. Can I ask you something?

929
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:21,957
So...

930
01:07:22,624 --> 01:07:24,832
Was it money that broke you two up?

931
01:07:31,957 --> 01:07:34,457
What? He hit you?

932
01:07:34,874 --> 01:07:36,457
That scumbag...

933
01:07:37,707 --> 01:07:40,332
I don't think Kaito meant to hurt you.

934
01:07:41,124 --> 01:07:46,457
People weren't recognizing his art
and that frustration just boiled over.

935
01:07:51,124 --> 01:07:52,457
Mugi's a good guy.

936
01:08:00,124 --> 01:08:04,332
Imagine having a matching tattoo
with your ex.

937
01:08:05,624 --> 01:08:09,124
Nana misses you. Dinner next week?

938
01:08:12,749 --> 01:08:18,207
They're letting me lead client
development for the Tokai region.

939
01:08:19,874 --> 01:08:20,999
Is that right?

940
01:08:22,082 --> 01:08:24,249
They want me to write a proposal.

941
01:08:24,749 --> 01:08:27,499
Plus, I've been building
good relationships so...

942
01:08:28,749 --> 01:08:29,957
Really?

943
01:08:32,624 --> 01:08:33,749
Sounds great.

944
01:08:57,842 --> 01:09:02,167
<font color="#FFFF00">My Star</font>

945
01:09:19,957 --> 01:09:21,582
- Hey...
- Was it a play?

946
01:09:23,124 --> 01:09:26,207
That thing you wanted to see.
When was it?

947
01:09:26,999 --> 01:09:29,499
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Watashi no Hoshi?</i></font> Saturday.

948
01:09:32,124 --> 01:09:34,207
Sunday is a work trip.

949
01:09:35,374 --> 01:09:37,457
I'm leaving early for Shizuoka.

950
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:39,707
I see.

951
01:09:40,124 --> 01:09:42,624
Okay. That's fine.

952
01:09:48,374 --> 01:09:49,457
Really.

953
01:09:55,499 --> 01:09:57,082
Fine. I'll go Saturday.

954
01:09:57,332 --> 01:09:59,624
Why? I said it's okay.

955
01:09:59,707 --> 01:10:01,582
It's not okay.

956
01:10:01,832 --> 01:10:03,332
You got tickets, right?

957
01:10:03,457 --> 01:10:04,832
It's work.

958
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:10,332
This doesn't give me
any pleasure, okay?

959
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:14,499
I hate having to say,
"Because of work."

960
01:10:14,707 --> 01:10:16,082
I know.

961
01:10:16,832 --> 01:10:19,832
Our lifestyles don't match up,
that's all.

962
01:10:21,207 --> 01:10:22,207
What?

963
01:10:26,332 --> 01:10:27,582
What I mean is...

964
01:10:30,249 --> 01:10:32,666
This is an important time.

965
01:10:32,749 --> 01:10:34,749
- I know.
- Your face said, "Again"?

966
01:10:34,874 --> 01:10:37,082
Well, it does keep happening.

967
01:10:37,874 --> 01:10:38,874
What I'm saying is...

968
01:10:38,957 --> 01:10:40,791
I said I'd go, didn't I?

969
01:10:40,874 --> 01:10:43,624
You said, "Fine, I'll go."
Like it's a chore.

970
01:10:43,707 --> 01:10:44,832
What?

971
01:10:45,957 --> 01:10:48,082
You've been saying "fine" a lot.

972
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:56,332
Don't look at me like
I'm being unreasonable.

973
01:11:00,124 --> 01:11:03,207
Fine, I won't look at you like that.

974
01:11:03,666 --> 01:11:05,666
Why do you have to say it like that?

975
01:11:05,749 --> 01:11:07,666
There you go, policing my speech.

976
01:11:07,749 --> 01:11:10,416
Can we just stop? This is so petty.

977
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:12,582
We've seen this play before anyway.

978
01:11:15,707 --> 01:11:16,832
Oh, wait...

979
01:11:19,374 --> 01:11:21,874
We'd been hoping it'd be revived,
weren't we?

980
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:27,249
Sorry.

981
01:11:35,832 --> 01:11:38,332
This was good.
Why don't you take it with you?

982
01:11:40,374 --> 01:11:41,374
Thanks.

983
01:11:47,082 --> 01:11:48,957
Good evening, sir. Yes?

984
01:11:49,457 --> 01:11:51,249
Saturday? Sure, I'll be there.

985
01:11:55,582 --> 01:11:56,707
Give me a minute.

986
01:12:17,707 --> 01:12:20,082
The first five years are the toughest.

987
01:12:20,499 --> 01:12:23,082
Things will get easier after that.

988
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:42,332
<font color="#FFFF00">Watashi no Hoshi</i></font>

989
01:12:47,832 --> 01:12:49,832
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you.

990
01:13:02,374 --> 01:13:03,832
How good is this food?

991
01:13:04,374 --> 01:13:07,624
I'd move to Shizuoka
just for Sawayaka restaurant.

992
01:13:09,624 --> 01:13:11,124
It's pretty amazing, yes.

993
01:13:26,124 --> 01:13:27,832
Oh, thanks.

994
01:13:28,124 --> 01:13:29,749
Thought you could use it.

995
01:13:35,332 --> 01:13:36,582
Oh, sorry.

996
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:41,624
Playing Zelda?

997
01:13:41,832 --> 01:13:45,082
Yeah. It's fun just
climbing the cliffs.

998
01:13:45,749 --> 01:13:49,332
Right now, I'm fighting
Divine Beast Vah Ruta.

999
01:13:51,832 --> 01:13:53,082
Want to give it a go?

1000
01:13:55,957 --> 01:13:57,207
Maybe not right now.

1001
01:13:58,207 --> 01:14:00,207
Of course not. Sorry.

1002
01:14:03,582 --> 01:14:05,082
You can leave the volume up.

1003
01:14:06,082 --> 01:14:08,874
I don't need to play right now.

1004
01:14:08,957 --> 01:14:10,124
Don't worry about it.

1005
01:14:10,582 --> 01:14:13,332
You've been working all day, too.

1006
01:14:40,999 --> 01:14:43,082
It's Christmas. Let's go shopping.

1007
01:14:44,332 --> 01:14:46,582
I said I wanted to watch a movie.

1008
01:15:23,499 --> 01:15:25,082
<font color="#FFFF00">Taberu no ga Osoi</font>

1009
01:15:39,624 --> 01:15:43,082
<font color="#FFFF00">Winning the Game of Life</font>

1010
01:16:04,832 --> 01:16:06,374
Good movie, huh?

1011
01:16:08,874 --> 01:16:09,874
Yeah.

1012
01:16:13,832 --> 01:16:17,207
One of my coworkers
is getting married.

1013
01:16:22,707 --> 01:16:23,874
Do you think about it?

1014
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,332
Like when you'd want to.

1015
01:16:34,457 --> 01:16:35,457
No?

1016
01:16:37,749 --> 01:16:41,082
I guess it never
really crossed my mind.

1017
01:16:44,707 --> 01:16:47,832
Maybe it won't hurt to
start thinking about it a little.

1018
01:16:50,832 --> 01:16:51,999
Maybe.

1019
01:16:53,707 --> 01:16:57,999
Any other movies you want to see,
or things you want done?

1020
01:17:01,832 --> 01:17:03,207
The balcony light.

1021
01:17:04,457 --> 01:17:05,457
It's out.

1022
01:17:10,332 --> 01:17:11,707
I forgot you'd asked me.

1023
01:17:12,874 --> 01:17:13,874
Sorry.

1024
01:17:13,957 --> 01:17:14,957
It's okay.

1025
01:17:16,707 --> 01:17:17,874
I'll take care of it.

1026
01:17:19,457 --> 01:17:20,457
Night.

1027
01:17:22,874 --> 01:17:23,874
Good night.

1028
01:17:25,832 --> 01:17:27,499
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I didn't get it.</i></font>

1029
01:17:28,332 --> 01:17:34,124
<i><font color="#80FFFF">How could he bring up marriage when

1033
01:18:28,332 --> 01:18:31,582
Maybe you guys just need
to spice things up a bit.

1034
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,207
Like how?

1035
01:18:33,374 --> 01:18:34,832
You could use toys.

1036
01:18:36,249 --> 01:18:37,707
Don't be ridiculous.

1037
01:18:38,249 --> 01:18:40,207
It's been three years, right?

1038
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:42,332
What?

1039
01:18:42,582 --> 01:18:46,332
So all three-year-old couples
are using toys in the bedroom?

1040
01:18:46,707 --> 01:18:48,082
Oh, Kaji.

1041
01:18:53,249 --> 01:18:54,957
- Hello.
- Hello.

<font color="#FFFF00">Notice of closing</font>

1043
01:19:14,957 --> 01:19:18,624
Apparently, a truck driver
drove his truck into the sea.

1044
01:19:18,832 --> 01:19:20,666
Wait, what does that mean?

1045
01:19:20,749 --> 01:19:21,749
Not sure.

1046
01:19:22,207 --> 01:19:23,957
Did you get the driver's name?

1047
01:19:24,332 --> 01:19:25,999
Lida. Know him?

1048
01:19:26,332 --> 01:19:30,499
I looked for lost cargo with him once.
We're the same age.

1049
01:19:31,207 --> 01:19:34,457
They're setting up a response team.
You'll be assigned.

1050
01:19:35,207 --> 01:19:36,832
Komura, you come with me.

1051
01:19:37,582 --> 01:19:38,624
Me?

1055
01:20:31,249 --> 01:20:33,582
This is bad. It's already making news.

1056
01:20:33,874 --> 01:20:39,457
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The driver was arrested in Niigata

Honestly, I envy him a little.

1063
01:21:07,874 --> 01:21:10,832
Must feel good to just
throw everything away.

1064
01:21:13,707 --> 01:21:15,374
You shouldn't envy him.

1065
01:21:17,082 --> 01:21:19,082
Life is about responsibility.

1066
01:21:20,082 --> 01:21:22,457
Huh, must be exhausting.

1067
01:21:24,624 --> 01:21:26,707
What's that supposed to mean?

1068
01:21:26,999 --> 01:21:28,582
Nothing. Good night, sir.

Yeah. It just keeps getting better.

1074
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:43,457
Hold on a sec.

1075
01:23:13,332 --> 01:23:14,332
What's this?

1076
01:23:21,999 --> 01:23:24,082
I was thinking of switching jobs.

1077
01:23:25,957 --> 01:23:26,749
What?

1078
01:23:26,832 --> 01:23:27,957
It's event planning.

1079
01:23:28,832 --> 01:23:31,749
A friend heard I liked movies
and asked me to join.

1080
01:23:32,499 --> 01:23:34,124
I'd be making a little less,

1081
01:23:34,582 --> 01:23:37,457
but I've been visiting them
and learning the ropes.

1082
01:23:37,582 --> 01:23:40,207
What about your clerical job?
What friend?

1083
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:43,249
I've already put in my notice.

1084
01:23:44,082 --> 01:23:47,166
My friend is the president
of that company.

1085
01:23:47,249 --> 01:23:48,707
Hold on a second.

1086
01:23:49,332 --> 01:23:51,499
This is all news to me.

1087
01:23:53,499 --> 01:23:54,499
Sorry.

1088
01:23:56,707 --> 01:23:57,707
I don't get it.

1089
01:23:57,999 --> 01:24:02,207
You took the exam and everything.
How can you just throw it all away?

1090
01:24:02,707 --> 01:24:04,624
I hear what you're saying.

1091
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:09,499
I just don't think
it's the right fit for me.

1092
01:24:09,582 --> 01:24:11,874
What does fit have to do with it?

1093
01:24:11,957 --> 01:24:15,082
Why event planning anyway?
Is that a good fit for you?

1094
01:24:15,332 --> 01:24:16,707
I can use my passions.

1095
01:24:17,582 --> 01:24:18,582
Your passions?

1096
01:24:19,582 --> 01:24:24,291
They organize things like
escape rooms based on manga,

1097
01:24:24,374 --> 01:24:27,041
and they do music promotion, too.

1098
01:24:27,124 --> 01:24:28,207
So kids' stuff?

1099
01:24:30,582 --> 01:24:31,707
I guess so.

1100
01:24:32,249 --> 01:24:34,624
But that's kind of their philosophy.

1101
01:24:34,957 --> 01:24:37,707
"Make play work and work play."

1102
01:24:38,374 --> 01:24:39,707
Lame.

1103
01:24:41,749 --> 01:24:43,749
I know it's kind of lame.

1104
01:24:43,999 --> 01:24:45,707
All they do is drink tequila.

1105
01:24:48,624 --> 01:24:49,957
Work isn't a joke.

1106
01:24:51,082 --> 01:24:54,916
What if you join those layabouts
and things go bad?

1107
01:24:54,999 --> 01:24:56,374
I'll figure it out.

1108
01:25:05,707 --> 01:25:06,749
You're right.

1109
01:25:08,457 --> 01:25:11,082
You've been responsible
in your work

1110
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:13,499
through all the hard times.

1111
01:25:13,582 --> 01:25:15,874
It's not hard. It's work.

1112
01:25:16,707 --> 01:25:19,707
I've been told to go to hell
and spat on by a client.

1113
01:25:20,082 --> 01:25:22,416
Sometimes I wonder if
I was born to apologize.

1114
01:25:22,499 --> 01:25:24,999
But it's not hard. It's work.

1115
01:25:25,249 --> 01:25:27,416
What's wrong with that client?

1116
01:25:27,499 --> 01:25:29,707
- He's an important man.
- No, he isn't.

1117
01:25:30,082 --> 01:25:32,582
Or maybe he is important,

1118
01:25:33,249 --> 01:25:36,707
but he'd feel nothing
reading Imamura's "Picnic."

1119
01:25:37,707 --> 01:25:39,874
To think such a man would hurt you...

1120
01:25:39,957 --> 01:25:40,957
Honestly,

1121
01:25:42,499 --> 01:25:44,124
I might not either anymore.

1122
01:25:47,499 --> 01:25:50,207
I never got past volume seven
of <i><font color="#80FFFF">Golden Kamuy.</i></font>

1123
01:25:51,207 --> 01:25:53,332
I can't remember <i><font color="#80FFFF">Land of Lustrous.</i></font>

1124
01:25:54,874 --> 01:25:56,832
I'm envious that you still read them.

1125
01:25:56,999 --> 01:25:58,457
Then read them.

1126
01:25:58,957 --> 01:26:00,291
Relax once in a while.

1127
01:26:00,374 --> 01:26:01,874
None of it relaxes me.

1128
01:26:01,957 --> 01:26:05,457
I only have the energy
to play Puzzle & Dragons.

1129
01:26:11,999 --> 01:26:12,999
But you see,

1130
01:26:14,249 --> 01:26:17,957
it's all so we can make a living.

1131
01:26:19,624 --> 01:26:20,874
So it's not hard.

1132
01:26:24,707 --> 01:26:27,332
You talked about
using your passions,

1133
01:26:27,999 --> 01:26:31,624
but to me, that just sounds like
you're taking life lightly.

1134
01:26:33,332 --> 01:26:37,749
Why should money matter
if we love each other?

1135
01:26:37,832 --> 01:26:40,374
It's for us. We may not
love what we do...

1136
01:26:40,457 --> 01:26:42,582
I don't want to do what I don't love.

1137
01:26:43,082 --> 01:26:44,291
I want to enjoy life.

1138
01:26:44,374 --> 01:26:45,832
Then let's just marry.

1139
01:26:46,624 --> 01:26:49,582
Let's marry. I'll be the breadwinner.

1140
01:26:49,707 --> 01:26:52,749
You stay home.
No need to work or do any chores.

1141
01:26:53,207 --> 01:26:54,874
Just do what you want.

1142
01:26:59,582 --> 01:27:00,957
Is that a proposal?

1143
01:27:04,457 --> 01:27:06,207
Did you just propose to me?

1144
01:27:10,874 --> 01:27:13,207
Wasn't quite what I'd imagined.

1145
01:27:22,957 --> 01:27:24,082
Forget what I said.

1146
01:27:31,832 --> 01:27:32,999
I'm sorry, too.

1147
01:27:42,832 --> 01:27:44,374
Tea might've gone bitter.

1148
01:27:55,707 --> 01:27:56,999
Tastes about right.

1149
01:28:01,249 --> 01:28:02,832
What've you been watching?

1150
01:28:03,124 --> 01:28:05,832
This show called <i><font color="#80FFFF">Master of None.</i></font>

1151
01:28:17,207 --> 01:28:20,332
Visitors with the number 11.

1152
01:28:21,707 --> 01:28:23,874
Thank you. Good luck.

1153
01:28:33,124 --> 01:28:34,124
Hey.

1154
01:28:35,957 --> 01:28:37,166
Congrats on the opening.

1155
01:28:37,249 --> 01:28:39,207
Thank you.

1156
01:28:39,624 --> 01:28:41,624
- That look suits you.
- Really?

1157
01:28:41,707 --> 01:28:43,582
- It's been a blast.
- Has it?

1158
01:28:46,207 --> 01:28:48,582
Has Kaji hit on you yet?

1159
01:28:48,707 --> 01:28:49,832
No way.

1160
01:28:50,207 --> 01:28:52,957
See? He's surrounded by pretty girls.

1161
01:28:53,374 --> 01:28:54,707
Good point.

1162
01:29:05,249 --> 01:29:07,999
Over 10,000 likes on Instagram.

1163
01:29:08,082 --> 01:29:09,707
10,000 likes?

1164
01:29:09,957 --> 01:29:11,624
- Impressive, right?
- Yeah.

1165
01:29:11,707 --> 01:29:13,249
- Per person?
- Yes.

1166
01:29:13,332 --> 01:29:16,457
- How many people do they have?
- I wonder...

1167
01:29:16,874 --> 01:29:20,541
- Look, she's finally awake.
- At last.

1168
01:29:20,624 --> 01:29:22,082
Why? What happened?

1169
01:29:22,207 --> 01:29:25,207
We came here, you had one drink,
and got plastered.

1170
01:29:25,374 --> 01:29:28,916
You got up in his face like,
"What do you think of me?"

1171
01:29:28,999 --> 01:29:31,332
Then promptly fell asleep on his lap.

1172
01:29:31,874 --> 01:29:32,874
There he is!

1173
01:29:34,332 --> 01:29:35,707
Good job today.

1174
01:29:35,832 --> 01:29:37,582
Thanks for everything.

1175
01:29:38,957 --> 01:29:40,207
Seriously, thank you.

1176
01:29:41,499 --> 01:29:42,582
You okay?

1177
01:29:43,207 --> 01:29:44,207
Yes.

1178
01:29:46,749 --> 01:29:48,207
Want to grab some ramen?

1179
01:29:52,082 --> 01:29:53,082
Come on.

1180
01:30:03,999 --> 01:30:06,749
<font color="#FFFF00">Kaji: See you tomorrow, then.</font>

1181
01:30:06,999 --> 01:30:08,457
<font color="#FFFF00">See you tomorrow.</font>

1182
01:30:28,874 --> 01:30:31,624
<font color="#FFFF00">Funeral</font>

1183
01:30:47,832 --> 01:30:49,249
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Kaito has died.</i></font>

1184
01:30:50,707 --> 01:30:54,249
<i><font color="#80FFFF">He had gotten drunk, slept in the tub,
and never woke up.</i></font>

1185
01:30:58,457 --> 01:31:02,957
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Whenever he got drunk, he'd propose
that we all go to the beach.</i></font>

1186
01:31:05,874 --> 01:31:11,207
<i><font color="#80FFFF">After the vigil, we had his favorite
ginger tempura soba noodles.</i></font>

1187
01:31:15,999 --> 01:31:18,957
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I wanted to stay up all night
talking about Kaito.</i></font>

1188
01:31:20,249 --> 01:31:21,707
I'm going to bed, okay?

1189
01:31:22,957 --> 01:31:25,082
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But she went off to bed early.</i></font>

1190
01:31:30,332 --> 01:31:31,957
<i><font color="#80FFFF">So instead I gamed a little.</i></font>

1191
01:31:35,249 --> 01:31:36,707
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Went for a walk.</i></font>

1192
01:31:38,707 --> 01:31:41,207
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Had a little cry and went to bed.</i></font>

1193
01:31:49,207 --> 01:31:50,249
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The next morning...</i></font>

1194
01:31:50,332 --> 01:31:51,666
Nana texted me...

1195
01:31:51,749 --> 01:31:54,124
<i><font color="#80FFFF">She started to say something.</i></font>

1196
01:31:54,374 --> 01:31:55,374
See you later.

1197
01:31:55,457 --> 01:31:57,207
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But I just didn't care.</i></font>

1198
01:32:07,707 --> 01:32:09,457
<i><font color="#80FFFF">My boyfriend lost his friend.</i></font>

1199
01:32:11,082 --> 01:32:12,874
<i><font color="#80FFFF">He wasn't a bad guy,</i></font>

1200
01:32:13,249 --> 01:32:16,749
<i><font color="#80FFFF">but he'd always hit on girls
when he got drunk.</i></font>

1201
01:32:19,332 --> 01:32:21,874
<i><font color="#80FFFF">He had once been abusive as well.</i></font>

1202
01:32:26,457 --> 01:32:28,999
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Of course,
I was sad about his passing,</i></font>

1203
01:32:30,124 --> 01:32:32,832
<i><font color="#80FFFF">but I couldn't share in
my boyfriend's grief.</i></font>

1204
01:32:37,582 --> 01:32:39,582
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I hated myself for that.</i></font>

1205
01:32:41,082 --> 01:32:42,916
Nana texted me...

1206
01:32:42,999 --> 01:32:45,332
<i><font color="#80FFFF">So I tried to talk about it
the next day.</i></font>

1207
01:32:45,457 --> 01:32:46,499
See you later.

1208
01:32:46,582 --> 01:32:47,957
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But it was too late.</i></font>

1209
01:32:50,499 --> 01:32:53,832
<i><font color="#80FFFF">None of it seemed to matter anymore.</i></font>

1210
01:32:59,249 --> 01:33:03,416
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Don't you ever think
you can use one of your lines</i></font>

1211
01:33:03,499 --> 01:33:08,249
<i><font color="#80FFFF">To brush off my feelings</i></font>

1212
01:33:08,499 --> 01:33:12,207
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Can't play nice anymore
don't want to be an outsider</i></font>

1213
01:33:12,624 --> 01:33:15,582
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I have to change now</i></font>

1214
01:33:15,999 --> 01:33:18,999
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'll take my dangerous words of love</i></font>

1215
01:33:19,082 --> 01:33:23,874
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And use them to throw you off balance</i></font>

1216
01:33:23,957 --> 01:33:27,832
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I want to feel you closer
not watch like some outsider</i></font>

1217
01:33:28,332 --> 01:33:33,624
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It all begins here</i></font>

1218
01:33:33,707 --> 01:33:34,707
Hey.

1219
01:33:35,082 --> 01:33:35,874
Hi.

1220
01:33:35,957 --> 01:33:38,707
Could you turn down the mic a bit?

1221
01:33:39,999 --> 01:33:42,124
<i><font color="#80FFFF">In the end, we broke up.</i></font>

1222
01:33:43,207 --> 01:33:46,457
But in a different universe,
we could've gotten married.

1223
01:33:49,082 --> 01:33:52,332
You get used to the parts of them
you don't like.

1224
01:33:53,749 --> 01:33:56,082
You get used to the negative feelings.

1225
01:34:01,832 --> 01:34:02,832
But...

1226
01:34:04,332 --> 01:34:06,499
Once you think of breaking up,

1227
01:34:07,707 --> 01:34:10,749
you can't stop picking at it
like a scab.

1228
01:34:12,749 --> 01:34:15,207
Love is a perishable thing.

1229
01:34:15,832 --> 01:34:17,457
There's an expiration date.

1230
01:34:18,582 --> 01:34:23,499
Past that date, you're just passing
the ball around, aiming for a draw.

1231
01:34:25,499 --> 01:34:26,582
It's like they say,

1232
01:34:26,832 --> 01:34:30,957
when you're lonely in a relationship,
the loneliness is compounded.

1233
01:34:33,582 --> 01:34:36,582
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I don't want you and Kinu to break up,</i></font>

1234
01:34:38,374 --> 01:34:40,707
but dating and marriage are different.

1235
01:34:44,582 --> 01:34:46,749
Maybe you should find someone else.

1236
01:35:08,582 --> 01:35:09,624
Hey.

1237
01:36:51,707 --> 01:36:52,832
Thanks.

1238
01:37:38,499 --> 01:37:40,749
Now for the ring exchange.

1239
01:37:45,624 --> 01:37:48,457
First, groom to bride.

1240
01:38:01,832 --> 01:38:06,874
To symbolize your love,
the bride and groom may now kiss.

1241
01:38:28,457 --> 01:38:31,457
I'm thinking of breaking up with Kinu.

1242
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:35,582
I'm thinking of breaking up with Mugi.

1243
01:38:36,582 --> 01:38:38,249
We barely talk anymore.

1244
01:38:38,582 --> 01:38:39,957
We don't even fight.

1245
01:38:40,582 --> 01:38:42,957
I just feel empty.

1246
01:38:43,624 --> 01:38:47,374
But I have no clue
how to bring it up.

1247
01:38:47,582 --> 01:38:50,166
I can't just say,
"This isn't working."

1248
01:38:50,249 --> 01:38:52,957
We're in our fifth year together.

1249
01:38:53,457 --> 01:38:54,749
It's like a mobile plan.

1250
01:38:54,832 --> 01:38:59,457
They make it purposefully hard
to cancel, hoping you'd reconsider.

1251
01:38:59,582 --> 01:39:02,832
"Don't end this.
You'll regret canceling now."

1252
01:39:02,957 --> 01:39:06,582
In any case, I've decided.
After this wedding...

1253
01:39:06,707 --> 01:39:08,624
we're breaking up.

1254
01:39:11,082 --> 01:39:12,082
But...

1255
01:39:13,457 --> 01:39:14,457
But...

1256
01:39:14,582 --> 01:39:17,207
I want to end it...

1257
01:39:17,499 --> 01:39:18,957
on a happy note.

1258
01:39:19,707 --> 01:39:22,624
Tell him, "Take care!"

1259
01:39:22,832 --> 01:39:26,457
Tell her, "I hope you find happiness."

1260
01:39:40,582 --> 01:39:41,707
Congrats.

1261
01:39:41,999 --> 01:39:43,374
Congrats.

1262
01:39:43,582 --> 01:39:44,749
Congrats.

1263
01:39:45,082 --> 01:39:46,499
Congrats.

1264
01:39:48,582 --> 01:39:51,207
Follow us to the after-party.

1265
01:40:01,457 --> 01:40:03,457
Ever been on a Ferris wheel?

1266
01:40:03,874 --> 01:40:05,832
Haven't you?

1267
01:40:06,832 --> 01:40:07,957
Don't think so.

1268
01:40:10,207 --> 01:40:13,082
Funny what you find out
after four years together.

1269
01:40:17,374 --> 01:40:18,374
Want to ride it?

1270
01:40:21,874 --> 01:40:22,874
Shall we?

1271
01:40:31,457 --> 01:40:35,082
Look at all these wedding favors.
Maybe they have Omi Beef.

1272
01:40:35,582 --> 01:40:37,624
Aren't we here to enjoy the view?

1273
01:40:37,707 --> 01:40:39,082
You like night views?

1274
01:40:40,124 --> 01:40:41,249
They're okay.

1275
01:40:42,124 --> 01:40:45,832
Honestly, I don't see
what's so enchanting.

1276
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:48,957
You're more enchanted by mummies.

1277
01:40:49,832 --> 01:40:51,541
You seemed pretty excited yourself.

1278
01:40:51,624 --> 01:40:54,124
That was for a different reason.

1279
01:40:54,582 --> 01:40:57,082
Well, it was our first date.

1280
01:40:57,707 --> 01:40:59,207
Inside, I was grossed out.

1281
01:41:01,707 --> 01:41:05,124
Well if you ask me, that gas holder
movie was hypnotic.

1282
01:41:05,332 --> 01:41:07,082
Weren't you fully asleep?

1283
01:41:07,457 --> 01:41:09,791
I totally was. I was deep asleep.

1284
01:41:09,874 --> 01:41:11,291
You totally were.

1285
01:41:11,374 --> 01:41:13,624
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Stay, I'm already in too deep</i></font>

1286
01:41:13,707 --> 01:41:15,749
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I've been evasive for so long</i></font>

1287
01:41:15,832 --> 01:41:18,124
<i><font color="#80FFFF">To be honest, I long to see you</i></font>

1288
01:41:18,207 --> 01:41:20,582
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I can't help it, how do you feel?</i></font>

1289
01:41:20,707 --> 01:41:22,999
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I want to change course of the future</i></font>

1290
01:41:23,082 --> 01:41:25,416
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Your hand is so tantalizingly close</i></font>

1291
01:41:25,499 --> 01:41:27,666
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I try my best to be closer to you</i></font>

1292
01:41:27,749 --> 01:41:30,124
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But somehow you seem out of reach</i></font>

1293
01:41:30,207 --> 01:41:32,291
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Who are you?
- Who are you?</i></font>

1294
01:41:32,374 --> 01:41:34,582
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- What do you mean?
- Someone tell me</i></font>

1295
01:41:38,374 --> 01:41:39,874
Guess we should head home.

1296
01:41:40,874 --> 01:41:42,207
Guess so.

1297
01:41:46,749 --> 01:41:47,999
But first...

1298
01:41:52,332 --> 01:41:55,457
First, maybe we can...

1299
01:41:57,332 --> 01:41:58,499
Go to our usual spot?

1300
01:42:00,457 --> 01:42:01,457
Yeah.

1301
01:42:09,332 --> 01:42:10,457
This way.

1302
01:42:25,207 --> 01:42:26,332
So...

1303
01:42:28,082 --> 01:42:29,332
It's okay.

1304
01:42:36,832 --> 01:42:38,249
Look at that smile.

1305
01:42:38,499 --> 01:42:39,832
It was a fun time.

1306
01:42:40,832 --> 01:42:41,874
Look who's talking.

1307
01:42:46,832 --> 01:42:48,207
When was this?

1308
01:42:49,082 --> 01:42:50,249
Maybe three years ago?

1309
01:42:50,332 --> 01:42:52,749
Time sure flew by.

1310
01:43:00,457 --> 01:43:02,207
Man, this is ancient.

1311
01:43:02,582 --> 01:43:03,999
We're so young.

1312
01:43:20,749 --> 01:43:21,874
It sure was fun.

1313
01:43:29,332 --> 01:43:30,582
It was fun.

1314
01:43:40,832 --> 01:43:41,874
Okay, then.

1315
01:43:48,582 --> 01:43:49,749
Let's talk.

1316
01:43:52,374 --> 01:43:53,457
Let's talk.

1317
01:43:58,457 --> 01:44:00,041
It can wait.

1318
01:44:00,124 --> 01:44:01,124
It should be now.

1319
01:44:03,082 --> 01:44:05,082
- Right here?
- I think that's best.

1320
01:44:06,832 --> 01:44:09,124
Today was a good day.

1321
01:44:16,832 --> 01:44:17,874
Four years...

1322
01:44:18,832 --> 01:44:21,457
These four years were so much fun.

1323
01:44:28,957 --> 01:44:29,957
Um...

1324
01:44:32,707 --> 01:44:34,207
So...

1325
01:44:36,374 --> 01:44:37,582
It's been...

1326
01:44:41,207 --> 01:44:42,332
a long journey.

1327
01:44:43,582 --> 01:44:45,207
A lot happened between us.

1328
01:44:46,624 --> 01:44:47,999
Despite that...

1329
01:44:49,082 --> 01:44:52,832
At least for me, personally...

1330
01:44:54,874 --> 01:44:57,707
every moment with you has been...

1331
01:45:02,457 --> 01:45:05,082
Oh, there's this other picture I saw.

1332
01:45:08,332 --> 01:45:09,332
Mugi.

1333
01:45:17,707 --> 01:45:18,874
Thanks for everything.

1334
01:45:20,957 --> 01:45:25,082
That's really all I can say.

1335
01:45:29,207 --> 01:45:31,374
I'll take all the good memories

1336
01:45:32,957 --> 01:45:34,457
and hold them close.

1337
01:45:35,624 --> 01:45:36,624
You should, too.

1338
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:39,332
Okay?

1339
01:45:42,332 --> 01:45:45,749
As for the apartment, I'll move out.

1340
01:45:46,457 --> 01:45:48,457
I couldn't afford the rent anyway.

1341
01:45:50,207 --> 01:45:54,332
You can choose if you want to
keep living there.

1342
01:45:58,207 --> 01:46:00,707
I'd like to take Baron,

1343
01:46:00,957 --> 01:46:02,582
but I'm sure you do, too.

1344
01:46:04,082 --> 01:46:05,707
So we'll talk about that.

1345
01:46:07,582 --> 01:46:09,624
Plus, Baron may have something to say.

1346
01:46:13,124 --> 01:46:14,332
What else?

1347
01:46:15,332 --> 01:46:17,707
The furniture, utilities...

1348
01:46:19,832 --> 01:46:20,832
So, yeah.

1349
01:46:24,832 --> 01:46:28,374
Anyway, about our time together...

1350
01:46:32,582 --> 01:46:33,832
I'm so grateful for it.

1351
01:46:38,207 --> 01:46:39,207
Kinu.

1352
01:46:41,624 --> 01:46:43,582
I don't want to break up.

1353
01:46:50,499 --> 01:46:51,957
We don't have to.

1354
01:46:54,332 --> 01:46:55,332
Let's get married.

1355
01:47:05,249 --> 01:47:06,457
We'll get married

1356
01:47:07,124 --> 01:47:10,499
and keep living our life.

1357
01:47:14,707 --> 01:47:15,957
It'll be okay.

1358
01:47:19,332 --> 01:47:22,249
You're only saying that
because it was a good day.

1359
01:47:24,082 --> 01:47:25,582
We'll backslide.

1360
01:47:26,082 --> 01:47:27,457
So what if we do?

1361
01:47:29,999 --> 01:47:32,582
Married couples are all like that.

1362
01:47:32,957 --> 01:47:34,499
They lose romantic feelings...

1363
01:47:40,999 --> 01:47:44,999
but they get married and it works out.

1364
01:47:47,332 --> 01:47:48,957
Despite a change in feelings,

1365
01:47:50,582 --> 01:47:54,124
they tuck that away
and keep living their lives.

1366
01:47:54,624 --> 01:47:55,624
You and I can...

1367
01:47:55,707 --> 01:47:57,082
Lower our expectations?

1368
01:47:59,582 --> 01:48:03,707
Lower our expectations and say,
"I guess this is as good as it gets"?

1369
01:48:04,707 --> 01:48:05,957
You're okay with that?

1370
01:48:06,874 --> 01:48:07,874
I am.

1371
01:48:11,582 --> 01:48:14,207
You can't expect
to be in love forever.

1372
01:48:14,582 --> 01:48:16,749
You'll never find happiness that way.

1373
01:48:17,249 --> 01:48:21,082
We fought all the time because
our feelings got in the way.

1374
01:48:22,124 --> 01:48:26,874
If we become a family now,
we can make it work.

1375
01:48:28,457 --> 01:48:32,332
We'll have kids, call each other
"Honey" and "Dear."

1376
01:48:33,124 --> 01:48:34,582
Can't you just imagine it?

1377
01:48:34,957 --> 01:48:38,374
The three or four of us will
hold hands, walk along Tama River,

1378
01:48:39,124 --> 01:48:40,832
go to the department store.

1379
01:48:41,707 --> 01:48:44,874
Buy a minivan, go camping,
visit Disney Land.

1380
01:48:45,874 --> 01:48:49,207
We'll take our time,
live out our lives.

1381
01:48:49,832 --> 01:48:51,582
And despite our history

1382
01:48:52,832 --> 01:48:55,624
we'll have become that happy couple.

1383
01:48:55,957 --> 01:48:58,082
It'll be as easy as breathing.

1384
01:49:00,832 --> 01:49:02,957
Let's become those two.

1385
01:49:05,249 --> 01:49:06,332
Let's get married.

1386
01:49:07,957 --> 01:49:09,249
Let's be happy.

1387
01:49:26,999 --> 01:49:28,582
You may be right.

1388
01:49:35,957 --> 01:49:37,082
I see your point.

1389
01:49:39,582 --> 01:49:41,874
If it were marriage.

1390
01:49:44,124 --> 01:49:45,207
If we became family.

1391
01:49:47,207 --> 01:49:48,249
That's right.

1392
01:49:48,457 --> 01:49:49,499
This way.

1393
01:49:49,874 --> 01:49:50,874
Thank you.

1394
01:49:52,582 --> 01:49:53,874
All you can drink, please.

1395
01:49:54,082 --> 01:49:56,582
- Make that two.
- Certainly.

1396
01:50:00,207 --> 01:50:02,582
Which seat would you like?

1397
01:50:04,749 --> 01:50:06,999
How about you?

1398
01:50:09,582 --> 01:50:13,249
Okay, then.
Why don't you take that side?

1399
01:50:14,749 --> 01:50:17,207
Okay, you take that side, then.

1400
01:50:18,082 --> 01:50:19,124
Okay.

1401
01:50:22,207 --> 01:50:23,457
I was surprised.

1402
01:50:23,582 --> 01:50:26,457
Me, too.
I didn't expect to run into you.

1403
01:50:26,707 --> 01:50:29,124
Do you see Hitsujibungaku often?

1404
01:50:29,207 --> 01:50:31,207
- This was my second time.
- Was it?

1405
01:50:32,207 --> 01:50:33,457
Who else do you like?

1406
01:50:34,457 --> 01:50:36,457
I listen to Hakushi Hasegawa.

1407
01:50:36,957 --> 01:50:40,082
Recently, I've gotten into
Soushi Sakiyama.

1408
01:50:40,207 --> 01:50:42,957
Sakiyama? I saw him play at Bay Camp.

1409
01:50:43,082 --> 01:50:45,749
- You did?
- He was incredible.

1410
01:50:45,832 --> 01:50:49,707
I had tickets, but then I got the flu.

1411
01:50:55,082 --> 01:50:59,582
We might've seen each other
at Bay Camp then.

1412
01:51:00,832 --> 01:51:01,832
You're right.

1413
01:51:03,832 --> 01:51:05,374
I'm glad we met today, though.

1414
01:51:06,249 --> 01:51:08,249
I'd forgotten to get your contact.

1415
01:51:09,207 --> 01:51:10,957
I'd been kicking myself, too.

1416
01:51:11,582 --> 01:51:16,832
But last time, we didn't quite click
as much as now, did we?

1417
01:51:17,207 --> 01:51:18,874
It was a bit awkward.

1418
01:51:18,957 --> 01:51:20,374
Right?

1419
01:51:23,499 --> 01:51:25,832
But after we met last time,

1420
01:51:26,707 --> 01:51:30,749
I found myself wondering
what you were up to.

1421
01:51:33,582 --> 01:51:34,624
Really?

1422
01:51:35,707 --> 01:51:38,957
Pretty constantly, honestly.

1423
01:51:40,749 --> 01:51:41,874
Me, too.

1424
01:51:44,082 --> 01:51:48,457
I was wondering what you were doing.

1425
01:51:53,332 --> 01:51:54,999
Pretty constantly.

1426
01:51:59,457 --> 01:52:00,749
Good thing we met today.

1427
01:52:04,332 --> 01:52:05,582
Indeed.

1428
01:52:15,082 --> 01:52:17,207
What are you reading right now?

1429
01:52:18,332 --> 01:52:19,499
What about you?

1430
01:52:20,082 --> 01:52:21,374
Ready?

1431
01:52:26,582 --> 01:52:28,832
Oh, I'd been wanting to read this.

1432
01:52:29,374 --> 01:52:30,374
Me, too.

1433
01:52:55,457 --> 01:52:57,457
Shall we get ourselves some drinks?

1434
01:52:58,457 --> 01:53:00,207
What's that you're reading?

1435
01:53:03,957 --> 01:53:04,957
And you?

1436
01:53:10,332 --> 01:53:11,582
- Here.
- Thanks.

1437
01:54:31,207 --> 01:54:35,124
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And that's how we broke up.</i></font>

1438
01:54:39,457 --> 01:54:40,624
You know,

1439
01:54:42,082 --> 01:54:44,832
there's this thing I tell myself
at times like these.

1440
01:54:44,957 --> 01:54:45,957
Yeah?

1441
01:54:46,249 --> 01:54:48,332
At the 2014 World Cup,

1442
01:54:48,957 --> 01:54:52,249
Brazil lost to Germany 7 to 1.
Remember that?

1443
01:54:52,332 --> 01:54:53,457
I remember.

1444
01:54:54,082 --> 01:54:58,082
I tell myself "At least I'm better off
than Brazil after that game."

1445
01:55:01,332 --> 01:55:05,124
Do you know what Brazil's captain
Júlio César said after they lost?

1446
01:55:05,374 --> 01:55:06,582
No.

1447
01:55:07,332 --> 01:55:12,249
Following his team's historic defeat,
Júlio César said the following.

1448
01:55:13,582 --> 01:55:16,624
"Our road here has been beautiful."

1449
01:55:18,124 --> 01:55:19,707
"We were so close."

1450
01:55:22,082 --> 01:55:23,207
You hear?

1451
01:55:31,332 --> 01:55:35,957
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But finding a new apartment
took some time,</i></font>

1452

1453
01:55:42,707 --> 01:55:47,332

or watch movies together.</i></font>

1454
01:55:49,332 --> 01:55:50,582
I have a confession.

1455
01:55:51,707 --> 01:55:56,874
I actually had hamburger steak
at Sawayaka after that one time.

1456
01:55:57,957 --> 01:55:59,499
Yeah? So did I.

1457
01:55:59,582 --> 01:56:00,582
What?

1458
01:56:03,582 --> 01:56:08,082
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Here we are drinking bubble tea
despite already having broken up.</i></font>

1459
01:56:09,207 --> 01:56:10,332
So in all honesty,

1460
01:56:11,457 --> 01:56:13,374
did you ever cheat on me?

1461
01:56:13,457 --> 01:56:14,457
Cheat on you?

1462
01:56:15,082 --> 01:56:16,207
Wait, did you?

1463
01:56:16,457 --> 01:56:17,207
Not once?

1464
01:56:17,332 --> 01:56:18,582
Never crossed my mind.

1465
01:56:19,207 --> 01:56:20,332
I see...

1466
01:56:25,832 --> 01:56:26,832
Hold on.

1467
01:56:27,957 --> 01:56:29,582
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

1468
01:56:31,832 --> 01:56:33,582
Why would you throw paper?

1469
01:56:33,707 --> 01:56:35,332
I'm a grown-up.

1470
01:56:36,457 --> 01:56:37,874
Baron!

1471
01:56:37,957 --> 01:56:39,916
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The cat became mine.</i></font>

1472
01:56:39,999 --> 01:56:41,957
You'd rather be with me, right?

1473
01:56:46,749 --> 01:56:47,832
Ready, go.

1474
01:57:22,457 --> 01:57:23,749
It's chilly.

1475
01:57:24,957 --> 01:57:26,249
- Thanks.
- Yep.

1476
01:57:29,957 --> 01:57:31,582
- Ready?
- Let's go.

1477
01:57:32,332 --> 01:57:33,374
You needed something?

1478
01:57:33,457 --> 01:57:35,999
Yeah, I want some new shoes.

1479
01:57:36,082 --> 01:57:38,457
Let's take a look around.

1480
01:57:39,707 --> 01:57:40,999
- This way?
- What shall I get?

1481
01:57:41,082 --> 01:57:42,499
I think so.

1482
01:57:42,999 --> 01:57:45,166
What kind of shoes shall I get?

1483
01:57:45,249 --> 01:57:46,999
- I'll pick one out.
- Really?

1484
01:57:47,124 --> 01:57:49,457
I need a decent pair of dress shoes.

1485
