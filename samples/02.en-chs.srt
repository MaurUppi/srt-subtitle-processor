00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:20,271
<i>前情提要...</i>
<i>Previously on The Institute...</i>

2
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:23,023
- 妈妈？
- 当然，孩子。随你心意。
- Mom?
- Sure, kid. Whatever you want.

3
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,450
欢迎来到研究所。
Welcome to the Institute.

4
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,580
你叫卢克·埃利斯。
来自明尼阿波利斯。
Your name's Luke Ellis.
You're from Minneapolis.

5
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,374
而且你很聪明。
And you're smart.

6
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,043
你是TK还是TP？
Are you TK or TP?

7
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:44,253
TP是心灵感应。TK是...
TP is telepathy. TK is...

8
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,672
念动力。
Telekinesis.

9
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:49,967
有时候东西会在我周围移动。
Well, sometimes things
move around me.

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,677
但这...这不足以...
But-but that
can't be enough to...

11
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:52,928
让你被带到这里？
To land you here?

12
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:54,138
我们现在在前区。
We're in Front Half right now.

13
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,681
- 还有后区吗？
- 是的。
- Is there a Back Half?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:57,224
等我们从前区毕业，就去的地方。
Where we go
when we graduate Front Half.

15
00:00:58,434 --> 00:00:59,894
欢迎你，卢克。
Welcome, Luke.

16
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:03,397
你见过安保主管，斯塔克豪斯先生。
You've met Mr. Stackhouse,
Chief of Security.

17
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,649
这位是亨德里克斯博士。
And this is Dr. Hendricks.

18
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,652
他是这里尖端科技的总设计师。
He's the architect of the
cutting-edge science we do here.

19
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,113
我是西格斯比女士，
我是...
My name is Ms. Sigsby,
and I'm...

20
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:13,324
老大，我知道。
The boss, I know.

21
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,576
毫无疑问，
You are, without question,

22
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,746
你将参与拯救世界的行动。
about to participate
in saving the world.

23
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,582
等你服役期满，
And then, when you come
to the end of your service,

24
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,084
我们会清除记忆，送你回家。
we'll wipe your memory,
send you home.

25
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,047
我们不是怪物。
We're not monsters.

26
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,092
听着，小子，
Well, Son,

27
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:35,262
你完全大材小用来做这份工作。
you are ridiculously
overqualified for this job.

28
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:36,555
问题是，我们是个好团队。
Thing is, we're a good crew.

29
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,057
你只是个街头找来的路人。
You're just
some guy off the street.

30
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,392
人们总开玩笑说夜巡员没用，
People joke about
a night knocker,

31
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:43,979
但对小规模警力很关键。
but it's key for a force
as small as ours.

32
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:47,733
这世界上每天都在发生
There are things going on
every day in this world

33
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:51,237
你绝对难以置信的事。
that you would
not fucking believe.

34
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,450
你说得对。她确实不可靠。
You're right.
She was unreliable.

35
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,035
"确实"？
"Was"?

36
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,162
已经处理好了。
It's taken care of.

37
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:02,957
卢克，这是尼基。
Uh, Luke, meet Nicky.

38
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,668
想离开就自己想办法。
Yeah, we want out,
we get ourselves out.

39
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,253
那么，聪明小子，
So, Smart Kid,

40
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,964
我们该怎么离开这个鬼地方？
how do we get
the fuck out of here?

69
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,914
随你高兴
If you'd like.

70
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,499
不如我许愿你能猜对我的年龄？
How about I wish you
got my age right?

71
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,459
这里只有13根蜡烛
There's only 13 candles.

72
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,170
哦 抱歉 亲爱的
Oh, sorry, honey.

73
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:58,507
这些代表你在前区度过的13天
These are for your 13 days in Front Half.

74
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,175
但现在你要启程了
But now you're on your way.

75
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,110
早上八点吃生日蛋糕？
Birthday cake
at eight in the morning?

76
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,820
「欢乐岛」记得吗？
"Pleasure Island," remember?

77
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,488
是啊 但这不代表
Yeah, but it doesn't mean

78
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:24,158
我想把糖霜当早餐好吗？
I want frosting
for breakfast, you know?

79
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,201
太他妈诡异了
It's fucking creepy.

80
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,218
嘿
Hey.

81
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,345
你今天要开始第一轮测试对吧？
You have your first day of tests today, right?

82
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,265
- 对
- 吃蛋糕 糖分有帮助
- Yeah.
- Eat the cake. Sugar helps.

83
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:56,065
- 帮什么？
- 信我就对了
- Helps what?
- Just trust me.

84
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,819
一切都会好起来的
Everything's gonna be all right.

85
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,179
所以 尼基...
So, Nicky...

86
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:31,475
尼基说你会想办法
帮他？
Nicky says you're gonna find
a way to help him?

87
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,602
会想办法帮我们所有人
Gonna find a way to help us all.

88
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,145
你就这么有把握？
You're that sure of yourself?

89
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,691
真让人羡慕
Must be nice.

90
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,611
艾瑞丝 时间到了
Iris, it's time.

91
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,033
她完全迷上他了
She's so into him.

92
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:51,078
知道吗 真好笑
她费尽心思
You know, it's funny.
She goes to all this trouble

93
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,248
想在心里对我隐瞒这件事 但...
to try and hide it from me
in her head, but...

94
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,291
我就想说「宝贝，你脸上都写着呢」
I'm like, "Babe,
I can see it on your face."

95
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,546
所以你们在一起了？
你和尼基？
So, you're together?
You and Nicky?

96
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,383
嗯 我...我不确定
Yeah, I-I wasn't sure.

97
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,677
看来我们半斤八两
I guess that makes the two of us.

98
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,638
说实话 我不知道
我和尼基算不算在一起
Truth is, I don't know
if Nicky and I are together.

99
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,474
我不知道我们是什么关系
I don't know what we are.

100
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,560
我是说 我认识他还不到两周 所以...
I mean, I haven't even
known him two weeks, so...

101
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,282
过几天见吧。
I guess I'll see you guys
in a few days.

102
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,283
- 好的。
- 行。
- Yeah.
- Okay.

103
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,742
嗯，回头见。
Yeah. See you soon.

104
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,936
天啊！
Jesus!

105
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,022
大日子啊，小老虎？
Big first day, huh, tiger?

106
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,607
你做好准备。
You get yourself ready.

107
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,109
我一两小时后回来接你。
I'll be back for you
in an hour or two.

108
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,336
走吧，艾瑞丝。
Come on, Iris.

109
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:33,429
"我们再也见不到她了。"
"We will see her no more."

110
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,798
- 早啊。
- 能搭把手吗？
- Hi. Morning.
- Hey, can you give me a hand?

111
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,299
- 呃，我正要...
- 帮个忙。
- Ah, well, I was...
- Please.

112
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,425
- 我本来...
- 太好了，麻烦你。
- I was, uh...
- Great, if you could.

113
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:11,468
- 我...
- 嗯。
- I was...
- Yeah.

114
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,469
...正要去拿...
...just about to grab...

115
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,971
- 好。
- 扶住她。
- Okay. Okay.
- Hold her, yeah.

116
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,223
- 出来了。
- 对...没错。
- There she is.
- That's a... yup.

117
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,516
- 是的。
- 没错。
- Yeah.
- Yup.

118
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,475
嘿。
Hey.

119
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,520
她喜欢你。
She likes you.

120
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:23,772
她单身。
She is single.

121
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:31,029
希望有警察住在附近
Hoping it'll give our regulars
some peace of mind having

122
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:33,573
能让老主顾们安心些。
a lawman living in their midst.

123
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,159
虽然可能会影响
Although it may cut back
on prom-night business

124
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:40,247
毕业舞会生意和本地孩子开房。
and local kids checking in
for weed and pillow fights.

125
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,581
是啊。
Yeah.

126
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,834
记得我们这位古利克森警官
Believe our friend，Officer Gullickson

127
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,086
几年前也是狂欢常客
used to be a part of those
revelries not so many years ago,

128
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,213
如果没记错的话。
if memory serves.

129
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:51,633
哦对了，她刚才来电
Oh, that reminds me.
She called a little bit ago

130
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,844
让你起床后
and asked me to have
you go down to the station

131
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,221
马上去趟警局。
as soon as you
were up and about.

132
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:57,639
那我该走了...
Well, I should probably go...

133
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,267
其实一开始
Actually, at first,

134
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,185
她想直接转接你房间
she wanted to be put
straight through to your room,

135
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,895
但你挂了勿扰牌。
but you had
the Do Not Disturb on.

136
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,356
我们斯坦顿酒店
And we at the Stanton Hotel

137
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,484
从不违背客人意愿。
pride ourselves on never
contravening our guests' wishes.

138
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,486
好，回见。
Okay, see you.

139
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,530
- 对吧贝蒂莉亚？
- 再见。
- Ain't that so, Bedelia?
- See you.

140
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,824
好了。
All right.

141
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,828
给你。
There you go.

142
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,413
甜蜜小家。
Home sweet home.

143
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,498
今早收到州警通报
We got a flash
from the Staties this morning.

144
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,126
有两个劫匪可能往这边来。
Two-man stick-up crew they think
might be headed this way.

145
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,586
一周前在新罕布什尔
They hit a convenience store

146
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,963
抢了便利店
down in New Hampshire
a week ago,

147
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,257
周一又在基特里作案
then a place in Kittery
Monday morning,

148
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,551
昨晚刚在班戈外围得手。
then last night
just outside Bangor.

149
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,136
要逃往边境？
Running for the border?

150
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,638
可能，除非他们往东走
Possible.
Unless they cut east,

151
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,349
1号路线应该
会把他们引到我们这边
Route 1 should
bring 'em right up our way.

152
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,017
明白
Got it.

153
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:48,190
所以你叫我来就为了警告我？
So, you called me
down here just to warn me?

154
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,441
电话里不能说吗？
Couldn't have done that
on the phone?

155
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,984
这就是大城市警校
That the kind of observation

156
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,986
教你的观察力？
they teach you to make
at big-city cop school?

157
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,906
警长让我问问，你要不要配枪
Chief told me to see if you
wanna be carrying a gun.

158
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,491
抓到人之前先用着
Just till we catch 'em.

159
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,493
保险柜里有几把备用格洛克
We got a couple of extra Glocks
in the safe.

160
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,370
这方面我自有准备
I'm all set on that front.

161
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,788
你有私人配枪？
You have your own weapon?

162
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,374
没有
I do not.

163
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,210
随你便
Suit yourself.

164
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,878
记住如果发生状况
And, obviously,
if anything goes down,

165
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,004
你唯一要做的就是上报
your only job is to call it in.

166
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:11,922
是 长官
Yes, ma'am.

167
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:19,096
有件事或许
你能帮上忙
There is one thing you might
be able to help me with.

168
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,099
这镇上哪儿能喝到
燕麦奶拿铁？
Where's a fella supposed to get
an oat milk latte in this town?

169
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,186
沃特维尔有家星巴克
There's a Starbucks
down in Waterville.

170
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,814
大概98英里远
It's about 98 miles.

171
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,066
不 这是大城市警察的玩笑
No, that was
a big-city cop joke.

172
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,484
我不喝拿铁
I don't drink lattes.

173
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,404
呼 那就好
听着...
Phew. That's a relief.
Look...

174
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,322
今晚务必小心
just be careful tonight.

175
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,408
要是那些混混真来了
Those punks
do roll through here,

176
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,034
粉笔可派不上用场
chalk's not gonna do much good.

177
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,663
也许吧 但别担心
Maybe. But don't worry.

178
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,124
他们斗不过我的机智魅力
They'll be no match
for my wit and charm.

179
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,795
想喝提神咖啡
You want some jet fuel,

180
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,922
去日出餐厅
往前两个路口右转
try the Sunrise Diner,
couple blocks down on the right.

181
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,133
谢谢 长官
Thank you, ma'am.

182
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,300
"长官"？
"Ma'am"?

183
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,469
女士？
Miss?

184
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,972
警官
Officer.

185
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,766
懂了
Got it.

186
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,149
她是绑架小组组长？
She was a snatch team leader?

187
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,818
是的 长官 去年刚晋升
Yes, sir. Promoted last year.

188
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,736
显然我们的审查程序
Obviously,
our vetting procedures

189
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,447
需要改进
need some improvement.

190
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,907
长官 正如西格斯比女士
和我讨论过的
Sir, as Ms. Sigsby
and I have discussed,

191
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,034
审查关键在于时间
vetting is all about time.

192
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:26,413
她多次向我强调
She's made me aware
on a number of occasions,

193
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,331
人员需求需要加快...
her staffing needs
require expediting...

194
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,668
不 我需要的是更多孩子
No. What I require is more kids.

195
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,336
作为绑架小组组长
And as a snatch team leader,

196
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,338
她知道全部行动细节？
she was privy to all aspects
of our mission?

197
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,966
不 长官 仅限前半区权限
No, sir. Front Half access only.

198
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,844
这并不能让人放心
That's hardly comforting.

199
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:44,222
你们跟踪她多久？
And you followed
this woman how long?

200
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,057
这是给您的
斯塔克豪斯先生
That's for you,
Mr. Stackhouse.

201
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,768
我们在三月份加强了被动监控措施。
We beefed up
passive surveillance in March.

202
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:52,314
上周已批准采取主动行动方案。
Active measures
were authorized last week.

203
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:57,152
"主动行动"是指...
你安插的记者？
"Active measures," meaning...
your reporter?

204
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:01,781
长官，我认为并非所有参会人员
都具备该权限...
Sir, I don't believe everyone on
this conference has clearance...

205
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:05,660
斯塔克豪斯先生，若我想让西格斯比女士回避
Mr. Stackhouse,
if I wanted Ms. Sigsby absent

206
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:08,163
这场谈话
她早就离开了
on this conversation,
she would be.

207
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,957
你确定那名叛徒
试图接触的对象
Now, you're confident your
reporter was the only person

208
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,668
只有你的记者吗？
that this traitor
tried to have contact with?

209
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,921
- 确定
- 那么西格斯比女士
- I am.
- Now, Ms. Sigsby,

210
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,215
我明白抓捕小组
I recognize that
the snatch team is not

211
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,467
不归你直接管辖
your direct responsibility.

212
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,802
但显然最有效的补缺方式
But obviously,
the most efficient way

213
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,263
是从你现有团队中
to fill this vacancy

214
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:28,433
抽调人手过去
is for you to move someone
over from your in-house staff.

215
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,102
你知道我们本来就人手不足
You... you know we're
undermanned as it is.

216
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,687
是的
Yes, I do.

217
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,773
但你也亲口说过
But you said so yourself.

218
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,733
随着新监控点的增加
With all the new keyholes
coming up,

219
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,361
真正需要的是更多孩子
what you really
need are more kids.

220
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,947
所以我真正需要的是
So what I really need

221
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,991
确保抓捕小组
全员待命
is for our snatch teams
to be at full strength.

222
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,577
现在我再问你一次
Now I'm going
to ask you once again

223
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:51,331
能否用更少资源
做更多事
to give me more... for less.

224
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,584
否则我只能向委员会
报告你...
Or I could simply tell
the Committee that you were...

225
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,462
无力完成既定目标数量
unable to handle the amount of
targets you've been assigned.

226
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,382
不不不 当然不是
我们都应各尽其责
No, no, no. No. Of course not.
We all have to do our part.

227
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,513
斯塔克豪斯先生的记者
怎么安排？
What about
Mr. Stackhouse's reporter?

228
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,640
想必已经过审查了吧
I presume she's been
through some vetting.

229
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,767
让她临时加入抓捕小组
What if she filled in
on the snatch team

230
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,144
直到找到正式替补如何？
until we had
a permanent replacement?

231
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:16,273
你觉得呢 斯塔克豪斯先生？
And how's that,
Mr. Stackhouse?

232
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,316
我会安排妥当
I'll make it so, sir.

233
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,943
很好
Very good.

234
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:35,208
所以你真策反了
一名记者？
So, you actually managed
to turn a reporter?

235
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,043
三年前安排她入职
I got her the job
three years ago

236
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:40,213
就是为了应对
这种状况
just for this kind
of eventuality.

237
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,301
还以为你会欣赏
我的深谋远虑
Thought you'd appreciate
my foresight.

238
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,719
确实欣赏
And I do.

239
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,387
但我不欣赏的是
What I don't appreciate
is you questioning

240
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,264
你在通话中质疑我的保密权限
my security status on that call.

241
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:52,809
放轻松 你知道他总对
权限问题小题大做
Easy. You know how worked up
he gets about clearances.

242
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,520
- 我只是给他个台阶下
- 却让我背黑锅
- I was just throwing him a bone.
- By throwing me under a bus.

243
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:56,855
真有意思
That's funny.

244
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,984
都忘了你这么幽默
I forgot how funny you could be.

245
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,652
没那么好笑
Not that funny.

246
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,617
你不会真以为我会
泄露机密吧？
You don't really think I'd
compromise this place, do you?

247
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,411
我知道你不会
I know you wouldn't.

248
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,456
这话还算中听
Well, that's
somewhat comforting.

249
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,207
哦 不是因为我信任你
Oh, not because I trust you.

250
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,084
而是因为你知道我清楚
But because I know that you know

251
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,838
要是这些事曝光了
that if ever
any of this comes out,

252
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,924
你也和我们一样完蛋。
you'd be just as screwed
as the rest of us.

253
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,641
你对今天的测试了解多少？
How much do you know
about what to expect today?

254
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,727
没想到你居然会在意。
Surprised you actually care.

255
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,687
我们是不是又得谈谈
Are we gonna have
to have another talk

256
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,939
让你好好配合的事？
about you being
a good cooperator?

257
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,859
听着 我知道你想测试我的TK基准值
Look, I know you're gonna try
to get a baseline of my TK.

258
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,779
省省时间吧 我无法主动触发能力
I'll save us both some time.
I can't do it on demand, okay?

259
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,989
只有受到刺激时才会显现
Only when something
activates it.

260
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,617
那我们就想办法刺激你咯？
Well, then we'll just have to
find a way to activate it, huh?

261
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,328
别总把"不行"挂嘴边 冠军先生
And let's take the "can't" out
of our vocabulary, huh, champ?

262
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,622
"不行"是弱者的口头禅
"Can't's a fucking beta word.

263
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,589
我是亨德里克斯医生
Ah, I'm Dr. Hendricks,

264
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,758
医疗部负责人
head of Medical Operations.

265
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,843
在西格斯比女士办公室见过
We met briefly
in Ms. Sigsby's office,

266
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,970
不过你当时状态不佳
but you weren't at your best.

267
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,224
卢克不喜欢握手
Oh, Luke doesn't shake.

268
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,352
没关系 完全没关系
That's all right,
perfectly all right.

269
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:21,564
但我说起跳时他会蹦起来
He does, however, hop up
in the chair when I say.

270
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,699
别又来你那套说教
Spare us another
teachable moment.

271
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,505
所以你真是医生？
So, you're, uh,
really a doctor, huh?

272
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,507
当然
Of course.

273
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,176
正经医学博士？不是心理专家那种？
But a medical doctor?
Not, like, Dr. Phil?

274
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,178
是的
Yes.

275
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,848
你们发的希波克拉底誓言呢？
What about all those oaths
they make you take?

276
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,349
"首先不伤害"原则呢？
"Primum non nocere"?

277
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,268
这和绑架未成年人
How does that square
with kidnapping

278
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,938
强制实验怎么自圆其说？
and testing without consent?

279
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,275
啊对 你是聪明那个
Oh, right.
You're the smart one.

280
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,153
不过你不是第一个
And yet, not the first

281
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,865
想用医德来难倒我的人
to think he can stump me
with Hippocrates.

282
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,491
我早就想清楚了
I assure you,
I've been all through

283
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,578
我们工作的道德边界
the morality
of the work we do here.

284
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,997
为了崇高目标可以不择手段
The ends more
than justify any means.

285
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,249
是吗？
Really?

286
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,917
- "拯救世界"是吧？
- 确实如此
- "Saving the world," right?
- As a matter of fact.

287
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,755
知道吗 "首先不伤害"
Hippocrates never
actually said it, you know?

288
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,007
根本不是希波克拉底说的
"Primum non nocere'?

289
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,009
拉丁语听着总是更高级
Everything just
sounds better in Latin.

290
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,094
- 显得更正式
- 不管是不是拉丁语
- It's more official.
- Latin or not,

291
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:36,222
希望你能明白这毫无意义
I hope you're smart enough
to realize it's meaningless.

292
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,725
"首先不伤害"
"First, do no harm."

293
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,103
所有手术都是伤害
All surgery is harm,

294
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,647
只是为更大利益服务的伤害
just harm in service
of a greater good.

295
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,274
- 别动
- 这是什么药？
- Hold still now.
- What's in that?

296
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,443
你关心这个干嘛？
What do you care?

297
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,154
要打进我胳膊里的
It's going in my arm, man.

298
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,740
没错 不管是什么都要打进去
That's right. It's going in,
whatever it is. Hmm?

299
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,534
现在别动
Now hold still.

300
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,620
你问药名无非是想
Only reason
you wanna know the name

301
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,206
这样你就能继续觉得自己比别人聪明。
is so you can go on
feeling smarter than everybody.

302
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,377
我想你的室友们跟你提过那些圆点的事吧？
I assume your bunkmates
have told you about the dots.

303
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,004
嗯？
Hmm?

304
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,173
提过一点。
Yeah, a little.

305
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,133
也说过发现它们时必须立即上报有多重要吧？
And how important it is
to tell us when you see them?

306
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:15,720
对，他们...他们跟我说了。
Yeah, they... they told me.

307
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:19,557
今天你不太可能看到那些圆点。
Very unlikely
you'll see them today.

308
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:23,228
今天是给你做基线测试的日子。
Today is about getting
your baselines.

309
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:27,106
你只需要放松坐着
All you gotta do
is sit back and relax

310
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,692
按照指示做就行。
and follow instructions.

311
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:36,407
嗯。
Hmm.

312
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,847
你必须知道！佐伊要你知道真相！
You need to know!
Zoe needs you to know the truth!

313
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,306
别再说她的名字！
Stop saying her name!

314
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,809
我只是想告诉你真相！
I'm just trying
to tell you the truth!

315
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,644
- 给我滚开！
- 佐伊！
- Get the hell out of my way!
- Zoe!

316
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,396
嘿，怎么回事？
Hey, hey, what's going on?

317
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,106
她疯了！她他妈就是个疯子！
She's crazy!
She's fucking crazy!

318
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,607
离我远点！
Stay away from me!

319
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,150
你不能再继续逃避了！
You can't keep
ignoring it anymore!

320
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,570
冷静，安妮。没事的。
Easy. Easy, Annie.
Everything's okay.

321
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,113
你怎么在这儿？
What are you doing here?

322
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,698
我正要去日出餐厅喝杯咖啡。
Well, I'm just on my way
to the Sunrise, grab a coffee.

323
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,700
吃早餐了吗？听说他们的煎蛋卷很棒。
You had breakfast yet?
I hear they make a mean omelet.

324
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,118
我得去警告她。
Huh, I've gotta warn her.

325
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,327
我知道。我知道，
I know.
I know, I know,

326
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,538
但你先得吃点东西。好吗？
but you gotta eat
something first. Okay?

327
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,790
这样吧，我请客。
Tell you what.
Tell you what, it's on me.

328
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,876
嗯？
Hmm?

329
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,460
我懂了。
I get it.

330
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:30,837
- 没事吧？
- 我需要...
- Everything all right?
- I need...

331
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,005
调度中心刚接到报警。
Dispatch just got a call.

332
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,465
斯隆太太？
Mrs. Sloane?

333
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,718
没事，一切都...都很好。
Yeah, yeah, everything's...
everything's fine.

334
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,219
都在掌控中，对吧？对吧？
All under control, right?
Right?

335
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:41,514
没人安全。没人能安全。
Nobody's safe.
Nobody is safe.

336
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,892
安妮，我知道警长已经厌倦讨论这事了。
Annie, I know Chief's
tired of going over this.

337
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,060
但你真的不能再骚扰斯隆夫妇了。
you cannot be bothering
the Sloanes anymore.

338
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,729
搞不好警长也是同谋。
Damn Chief could be in on it
for all I know.

339
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,647
- 天呐安妮。
- 你们可能都是同谋！
- For God's sake, Annie.
- You all could be in on it!

340
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,274
连我也是？
Even me?

341
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:55,236
这个...你刚来不久，所以...
Well, I...
You're new here, so...

342
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,697
但很快你就会知道真相。等着瞧吧！
But you'll learn the truth
soon enough. You'll see!

343
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,198
安妮，要不要来警局
Annie, you wanna come down
to the station,

344
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,366
和艾什沃斯警长谈谈？
talk to Chief Ashworth?

345
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,201
哦，我觉得没这个必要。
Oh, I don't think
we need to do that.

346
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:04,787
我和安妮正准备去吃早餐。
Annie and I were about
to go get some breakfast.

347
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,081
不用了，谢谢你们。
No, thank you, both of you.

348
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:10,126
我...我还有事要办。
I-I got errands to run.

349
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,753
好吧，只要你要办的事
All right, well,
as long as those errands

350
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:16,341
不包括去打扰可怜的斯隆太太。
don't involve going anywhere
near poor Mrs. Sloane.

351
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,384
小心他。
Careful with him.

352
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,304
他们长得和我们一样。
说话也像我们。
They look just like us.
Sound like us, too.

353
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,641
除了脚趾。
Except for the toes.

354
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,018
你得看小脚趾。
You gotta look
at the pinky toes.

355
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,395
它们...它们弯曲得很奇怪。
They're... they're
bent all funny.

356
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,814
哦！
Oh!

357
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,653
你以为自己是在做善事吗？
Suppose you think you're being
some kind of humanitarian?

358
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,488
和疯女人搞好关系？
Make nice with the crazy lady?

359
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,822
说实话，德鲁，我...
Tell you the truth,
Drew, I, uh...

360
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,491
我还没仔细想过。
I guess I hadn't
really thought about it.

361
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,076
好吧。既然现在开始想了，
Okay. Well, now that
we're thinking about it,

362
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,994
不如想想斯隆夫人的感受？
why don't we think about what
it's like for Mrs. Sloane?

363
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,205
失去孩子已经够惨了。
Bad enough she had
to bury a child.

364
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,581
现在还有你那个疯朋友
Now she's got your crazy friend

365
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,249
试图说服她这不是意外。
trying to convince her
it wasn't an accident.

366
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,334
你得给我解释清楚，伙计。
You're gonna have
to fill me in here, pal.

367
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,961
不，这不是我的工作。
No. Not my job.

368
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,463
你只要确保她远离凯莉·斯隆。
You just make sure she stays
away from Kelly Sloane.

369
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:07,433
我告诉你，
I'm telling you,

370
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,852
你们这是在自找失望。
You guys are setting yourself up
for disappointment.

371
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,147
这个不用你操心。尽力而为吧。
Let us worry about that.
Just try as hard as you can.

372
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,996
我真的在努力。
I'm really trying.

373
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,289
那就再加把劲，嗯？
Well, try harder. Hmm?

374
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:35,920
有进展吗？
Anything?

375
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,302
抱歉，我真的尽力了。
I'm sorry. I'm really trying.

376
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:46,055
我们这是在死马当活马医啊。
We're really scraping the bottom
of the barrel here, huh?

377
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,473
集中注意力，卢克。
Concentrate, Luke.

378
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,111
托尼，给他点鼓励。
Ah, Tony, give him a boost.

379
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:06,075
不，不要了，求你了。
No. No, no. No more, please.

380
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,747
我说过，今天不太可能看到光点。
Like I said, it's very unlikely
you'll see the lights today.

381
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,623
不过万一看到了，
On the off chance
you do, though,

382
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:16,586
你必须立刻告诉我们，
I need for you to let us know
immediately,

383
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,463
这是为你的安全着想。
for your own safety.

384
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,797
为我的安全...
For my safe...

385
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:23,259
还有，尽量咬紧牙关。
Also, do try to keep
your teeth clenched.

386
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,303
我可不想你咬断舌头。
I'd hate for you
to bite off your tongue.

387
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,336
好吧。
All right.

388
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:15,436
哈！我说过你能行的，冠军。
Huh! Told ya
you could do it, champ.

389
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,021
如果连你自己都不相信自己，
No one's gonna believe in you

390
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,147
别人更不会相信你。
if you don't
believe in yourself.

391
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,232
我...
I...

392
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,819
我觉得我要吐了。
I think I'm going to be sick.

393
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:29,867
让他坐这儿休息几分钟，
Okay, uh, let him sit here
a few minutes,

394
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,452
给他杯水，
give him a glass of water,

395
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,371
清理干净。
clean him up.

396
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,252
]
]

397
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,420
放松点，第一次都这样。
Easy. First time is rough.

398
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,548
给，这个能帮你。
Here, this'll help.

399
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,924
薄荷糖。
Spearmint.

400
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,636
看到光点了吗？
You see the dots yet?

401
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,806
没关系，你会的，
然后就会感觉好些。
That's okay. You will,
then you'll feel better.

402
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,891
说到这个，
Speaking of which,

403
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:57,103
你该吃点东西，
让胃舒服些。
you should eat something,
settle your stomach.

404
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,947
你看起来糟透了。
You look like shit.

405
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,448
谢谢。
Thank you.

406
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,409
我刚打了第一针点剂。
Had my first shots for dots.

407
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,536
跟我说说吧。
要知道，我第一次打针时，
Tell me about it.
You know, first time for me,

408
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,246
用牙咬住针头拔出来
I ripped the needle out
with my teeth

409
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:18,332
直接扎进了亨德里克斯的蛋蛋。
and jabbed it right
into Hendricks's balls.

410
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,876
真的假的？
Did you really?

411
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,544
假的。
Nah.

412
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,004
不过我想这么干，
现在还想。
I wanted to, though,
and I still may.

413
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,964
其实我吐在了新帆布鞋上。
Truth is, I barfed
all over my new Chucks.

414
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:28,634
小心点，乔治。
慢慢来。
Careful, George.
Just take it slow.

415
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:30,094
嘿！嘿！
Hey! Hey!

416
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,266
比起乔治刚经历的，
这都不算什么。
Guess it was nothing compared to
what George just went through.

417
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,059
那是什么？
What's that?

418
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,561
叫"梦境箱"。
It's called the "Dream Box."

419
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,147
是前区最后的测试。
It's the final test
in Front Half.

420
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,483
随时可能轮到我们。
Expecting it any day now.

421
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,569
知道是干什么的吗？
Any idea what it does?

422
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,363
据说是把你潜意识里
From what I'm told, it shows you

423
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,824
最糟糕的东西都挖出来。
all kinds of bad shit it dredges
up from your subconscious.

424
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,452
艾瑞斯管这叫
个人恐怖电影。
Iris calls it your
own personal horror movie.

425
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,246
只有对齐灯光
才能停止。
Only way to make it stop's
by lining up the lights.

426
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,624
证明你准备好
进入后区了。
Shows 'em you're
ready for Back Half.

427
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,459
能反抗吗？
Can you fight it?

428
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:05,254
呃，可以试试。
Well, I mean, you can try.

429
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:07,215
嘿，小情侣。
Hey, lovebirds.

430
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:08,966
最近看到光点了吗？
See any dots lately?

431
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,093
你脑子里全是光点吧。
You got dots for fucking brains.

432
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,387
随时奉陪，小子。
You and me, kid. Anytime.

433
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,806
嗯？
Hmm?

434
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,100
哦。
Oh.

435
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,436
抱歉。
I'm sorry.

436
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,980
你迟到了。
You're late.

437
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,940
是...对不起，我...
Yes, I-I-I'm sorry. I don't...

438
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,984
吃药了吗？
Did you take your pill?

439
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,695
- 你看不出来吗？
- 不想看。
- Can't you tell?
- I don't wanna look at it.

440
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:13,948
"化学让生活更美好"
"Better living
through chemistry."

441
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,242
给你。
There you go.

442
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,410
带跳绳了吗？
You have that jump rope?

443
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:18,828
能别说话吗？
Could you not talk?

444
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,832
收到。
Roger that.

445
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,795
别卖关子，
有办法出去吗？
Don't leave me in suspense.
Is there a way out of here?

446
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,463
听着，总有办法的。
Look, there's always a way.

447
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:31,590
这就像策略游戏。
It's pretty much
a strategy game.

448
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:34,635
难点在于想出
他们没防备的招，
The challenge is thinking
of a way they haven't

449
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:37,305
至少是他们觉得
我们不敢试的。
or, at least,
one they don't think we'd try.

450
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:38,973
好，洗耳恭听。
Okay, I'm all ears.

451
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,516
我们还没...
还没到那一步，明白吗？
We're not...
we're not there yet, okay?

452
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,351
我们还在收集数据。
We're still gathering data.

453
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,522
目前看到的监控摄像头
Now, the security cams I've seen

454
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,983
看起来像是十年前
最先进的型号。
look like they were maybe
state-of-the-art ten years ago.

455
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,528
每个公共区域都有一个
One in every communal room

456
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:56,073
每条走廊两端各一个
都是运动感应的。
and one on either side of every
hallway, all motion-activated.

457
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,451
估计连接了Wi-Fi网络
Guessing they're linked
into the Wi-Fi,

458
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:01,412
但应该还有有线备份。
but, you know, there's
probably a hardwire backup.

459
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,040
好，那我们
怎么破坏它们？
Okay, so,
how do we knock 'em out?

460
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:08,252
不知道。你手边有
Wi-Fi干扰器吗？
I don't know. Have you got maybe
a Wi-Fi jammer lying around?

461
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:10,463
或者四级激光笔之类的？
Or, I don't know,
a Class 4 laser pointer?

462
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,426
刚用完。
Fresh out.

463
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,932
我猜主服务器
锁得很严实。
My guess is that main server
is locked up tight.

464
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:23,809
所以我们没法破坏监控？
So, we can't knock them out?

465
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,646
有什么好笑的？
What's so funny?

466
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:31,067
托尼说"没法"是菜鸟用语。
Yeah, Tony says
"can't's" a beta word.

467
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,405
真他妈讨厌那家伙。
Fucking hate that guy.

468
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:39,450
还是解决不了摄像头问题。
Still doesn't get us
past the cameras.

469
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,786
最简单的办法
Well, the easiest way to do that

470
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,330
就是发展内应。
would be to recruit
an inside man.

471
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,791
内应？在这里？
An inside man? Here?

472
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:50,628
听着，所有组织
都有薄弱环节
Look, all organizations
have weak links. Okay?

473
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:53,005
人们都有不为人知的
怨恨和秘密。
People have secret resentments,
secret lives.

474
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:55,383
关于间谍招募
有很多好书可以参考。
There are a lot of good books
on spy recruitment.

475
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,259
M-I-C-E... MICE法则
M-I-C-E... MICE.

476
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:00,262
金钱、意识形态、胁迫、自负。
Money, Ideology, Coercion, Ego.

477
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:03,891
问题是我们只有一次机会
The only problem we have
is we only get one shot.

478
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,851
如果招募被拒绝
We recruit one of the staff,
get turned down,

479
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,395
对方会报告给
西格斯比或斯塔克豪斯。
and they report it
to Sigsby or Stackhouse.

480
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,647
是啊，没有第二次机会。
Yeah. No second chances.

481
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,315
而且时间紧迫。
Plus, we don't have
a lot of time.

482
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,192
卡丽莎说孩子们
Kalisha said
the average Front Half stay

483
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:16,028
在前区平均停留15天。
of any kid she's seen
is about 15 days.

484
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:20,157
我们需要的是
超强心灵感应者
What we really need
is a super powerful TP.

485
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,617
能读取工作人员思想
See inside the minds
of the staff,

486
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,911
包括他们隐藏的想法。
even the stuff they're hiding.

487
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:26,163
甚至能不知不觉
扰乱他们思维。
Maybe scramble their brains
without them realizing it.

488
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:27,790
连卡丽莎都没这么强。
Even Kalisha's
not strong enough for that.

489
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,376
而且等能力发展到那程度
Plus, by the time anyone
develops any real power,

490
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,919
就会被转移走了。
they get shipped out.

491
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,676
那是什么鬼东西？
What the fuck is that?

492
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:45,224
没人知道
每周都会出现。
Nobody knows.
It happens every week or so.

493
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,522
看起来不太环保。
Doesn't look very eco-friendly.

494
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,441
你怎么不去举报他们？
Yeah, why don't you report 'em?

495
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,835
德鲁告诉我
今天安妮的事。
Drew told me what happened
with Annie today.

496
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,296
听说你成功安抚了她。
Sounds like you
really calmed her down.

497
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,549
- 这可不简单
- 是啊
- That's not easy.
- Yeah, well, um,

498
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,177
我对这种事有点经验。
I have some experience
with that kinda thing.

499
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,636
- 是吗？
- 对
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

500
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,555
因为我妈妈。
Yeah, my mom.

501
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,642
抱歉。你父亲呢？
I'm sorry. What about your dad?

502
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,311
呃...
Oh, um...

503
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:33,481
他...他试着照顾过她一阵子
Yeah, he... he tried
to look after her for a bit.

504
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:37,026
但他离开后 她就开始停药了
But after he left,
she started going off her meds.

505
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,445
安抚她就成了我的工作
Basically became
my job to defuse her.

506
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,613
嗯
Hmm.

507
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,156
你肯定很擅长这个
I bet you were good at it.

508
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,241
她只是需要有人倾听
Well, she just needed
someone to listen to her.

509
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:46,035
她的妄想看似荒谬
Her delusions
might've seemed crazy,

510
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,330
但我总能发现其中有些真实成分
but I usually found there was
some grain of truth to 'em.

511
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,582
比如安妮和凯莉·斯隆的事？
Like Annie and Kelly Sloane?

512
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,335
什么意思？那不是意外？
What do you mean?
It wasn't an accident?

513
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,587
什么不是意外？
What wasn't an accident?

514
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,506
凯莉·斯隆女儿遭遇的事
Whatever happened
to Kelly Sloane's daughter.

515
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,549
那地方叫红台阶
Place is called the Red Steps.

516
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,301
- 嗯哼
- 其实不是台阶
- Mm-hmm.
- Not really steps,

517
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,470
只是河中央的岩石群
just a rock formation
in the middle of a river.

518
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,056
也不怎么红
Not really red either.

519
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,225
和土壤里的铁含量有关
Something about the iron content
in the soil.

520
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,937
总之我从小就被告诫
Anyway, all the time
I was growing up,

521
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,022
绝对不能在红台阶附近游泳
our parents told us never
swim near the Red Steps.

522
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,733
说那里的水流经过岩石时
Something about the way the
current gets around the rocks.

523
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,402
会把人卷下去
It can pull you under,

524
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,321
即使水面平静如镜
even when the surface
is calm as glass.

525
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,323
我们那儿也有类似的地方
We, uh,
we had a place like that.

526
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,534
废弃的花岗岩采石场
Abandoned granite quarry.

527
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:28,827
孩子们叫它'溺水机器'
Kids used to call it
'the drowning machine'.

528
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,251
我九年级时 几个毕业生在返校节前夜
When I was in ninth grade,
a few seniors went drinking

529
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,670
跑去红台阶喝酒
up at the Red Steps
night before homecoming.

530
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:40,965
可能是醉酒失足
Maybe they got tipsy
and fell in,

531
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,342
或是醉到真的想游泳
or maybe they got drunk enough,

532
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,511
总之四天后发现了尸体
they actually decided
to go for a swim.

533
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,556
两男两女
Either way, their bodies
washed up four days later.

534
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,934
其中一个女孩是佐伊·斯隆
Two boys, two girls.

535
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,562
凯莉的女儿
One of the girls was Zoe Sloane.

536
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:56,814
天啊
Kelly's daughter.

537
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,107
没想到安妮当时就在镇上
Jesus.

538
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:02,361
她不在
I didn't realize that
Annie was here back then.

539
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,154
她肯定是听说了这事
No, she wasn't.

540
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,324
然后坚信不是意外
She must've heard the story,

541
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:09,118
现在她脑子全乱了
convinced somehow
it wasn't an accident.

542
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,203
和其他阴谋论搅在一起
I don't know. It's all
messed up in her head now,

543
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:12,913
但这对凯莉·斯隆打击很大
combined with her
other conspiracy stuff,

544
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:15,874
我能想象
but it's been very upsetting
for Kelly Sloane.

545
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,626
安妮时好时坏
I can imagine.

546
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,837
有次她说...
Annie's got her
good days and bad.

547
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,841
她知道我母亲对我的昵称
Yeah. Yeah, something
she said... she, um...

548
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,468
安妮偶尔会说些惊人的话
She knew what
my mother used to call me.

549
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:30,222
她总能接收到些奇怪的频率
Yeah, Annie'll say some pretty
mind-bending shit time to time.

550
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:33,100
[翻译结果缺失]
She's tuned into
some strange frequencies.

551
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,853
嗯...我今晚过去一趟
Well... I'll go by tonight,

552
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,479
看看她情况怎么样
check on her,
see how she's doing.

553
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:38,856
你真是有心了
Well, that's good of you.

554
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,524
每个小镇都有这样的人吧
I guess every town's got one.

555
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,318
是啊
Yeah.

556
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,070
不 我不是那个意思...
No, I didn't mean...

557
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:49,491
没关系 都过去很久了
Oh, no, that's okay.
It was a long time ago.

558
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:50,993
谢谢你的咖啡
Thank you for the coffee.

559
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,070
你只剩最后一次机会了
You literally have
one guess left.

560
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,613
- P
- 不对
- P.
- No!

561
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:28,822
- 好吧
- 输了
- Okay.
- Dead.

562
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:30,199
你真菜
You suck.

563
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,701
重开一局 快点
Off the bat.
Start a new round. Come on.

564
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,412
等等 什么词来着
Okay. fuck.
Wait. What word?

565
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:38,123
快猜
Come on.

566
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:39,625
我正在想
I'm trying to think.

567
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,420
绝了
Amazing.

568
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,798
- 嘿兄弟
- 快看这个
- Hey, man.
- Hey. Check it out.

569
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:08,862
卧槽
Holy shit.

570
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,739
厉害啊
Impressive.

571
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,951
太牛了
Very impressive.

572
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,995
梦境舱很烂 但对我的TK能力帮助很大
Dream box sucks, but it's
done wonders for my TK.

573
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:20,124
这就是...它的用途吗
Is that the, uh...
is that the purpose?

574
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,667
强化TK能力
To amp the TK?

575
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,836
能强化所有能力
Amps everything.

576
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,629
感觉怎么样
How are you feeling?

577
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:28,173
像被人打成脑震荡
Like someone turned
my brain into a smoothie,

578
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:31,760
不过总体还行
but otherwise, all good.

579
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:34,930
你的TP能力呢
Mm. And how about your TP?

580
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,682
那些灯是你移动的吗
Did you, uh,
make those lights move?

581
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,184
应该是
I think so.

582
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:40,936
记不清了 你要买什么
I don't really remember.
What can I get for you?

583
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,105
呃...
Uh...

584
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,736
给我杏仁糖和维生素D3
Give me, uh, Almond Joy, D3.

585
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:51,864
还以为你会选椰子糖
Huh. I had you
for a Mounds kinda guy.

586
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,699
我总能给人惊喜
Well, you know,
I'm full of surprises.

587
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,675
- 谢谢
- 不客气
- Thank you.
- Any time.

588
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,387
- Y
- 对了
- Y.
- Yes! Yes!

589
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:16,847
偶尔也能蒙对
Sometimes it works.

590
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,098
元音字母嘛
It's a vowel.

591
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,433
不算太差 继续
Not that bad. Come on.

592
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:20,809
嗨
Hi.

593
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,101
嘿
Hey.

594
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:25,022
乔治好像好些了
Uh, George seems
a little better.

595
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,690
- 那就好
- 但维持不了多久
- Okay.
- Yeah, not for long.

596
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:29,150
如果他能移动梦境舱里的灯
If he was able to move those
lights in the dream box,

597
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,027
下次就轮到他进BH了
he's the next up for the BH.

598
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,654
你确定这不是好事
And you're 100% sure
that isn't a good thing?

599
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,239
又来了
Oh, here we go again.

600
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,949
听我说 别喝红色酷爱饮料
I'm telling you, Sha,
don't drink the red Kool-Aid.

601
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:39,661
在这里任何人告诉你的话
都是谎言。
Anything anyone tells you
in this place is a lie.

602
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,580
绝对的。
Period.

603
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,206
那莫琳呢？
What about Maureen?

604
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,625
少来这套。
Fucking spare me.

605
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,757
好吧，
来打乒乓球怎么样？
All right,
how about some ping-pong?

606
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,634
- 来吧。
- 好啊。
- Come on.
- Okay.

607
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,427
嗯，明白。
Uh, yeah, gotcha.

608
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:56,929
卢克，帮帮我。
Luke, help me out here.

609
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,597
我知道你不信
莫琳那套
I know you're not buying
Maureen's whole

610
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,183
随大流的说辞。
go-along-to-get-along spiel.

611
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:07,564
我不确定。
I don't know, man.

612
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,941
感觉她可能
是个真实的人。
Feels like there may be
a real person in there.

613
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,318
- 看见没？
- 是啊。
- See?
- Yeah.

614
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,320
如果莫琳是假的，
她为什么要告诉我们
If Maureen weren't for real,
then why would she tell us

615
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,489
所有摄像头
听不到的地方？
about all the spots where
the cameras can't hear us?

616
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:16,990
在我看来，艾瑞斯走了后，
现在唯一能信任的
Far as I'm concerned, with Iris
gone, the only people

617
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:18,408
就只有
这个房间里的人。
we can trust
are in this room right now.

618
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:19,618
再加一个。
Plus one more.

619
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,411
今晚会有
新孩子来。
They're getting
a new kid tonight.

620
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,831
他叫埃弗里·迪克森
来自盐湖城。
His name's Avery Dixon
from Salt Lake City.

621
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:26,291
他们会把他
安排进艾瑞斯的房间。
They're gonna put him
in Iris's room.

622
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,418
你准备对他施展
惯用伎俩吗，莎？
You gonna work your usual magic
on him, Sha?

623
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,170
滚开！
我真的得过水痘！
Fuck off!
I really had the chicken pox!

624
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:31,880
我不知道。
I don't know.

625
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:35,092
看这孩子的房间，
他可能
Judging by this kid's room,
looks like he may be

626
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,510
还太小不适合"魔法"。
a little young for "magic."

627
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,053
好了，你们两个
都别说了。
Okay, both of you need
to just drop this.

628
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,304
说真的，太荒谬了。
Seriously, this is ridiculous.

629
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:41,265
看我拿到了什么。
Look what I got.

630
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:42,641
哦，别这样。
Oh, come on.

631
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,644
不行！不行！
No! No!

632
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,020
也有我一份。
It's mine too.

633
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:50,148
- 我不能...
- 呃，乔治？
- I can't...
- Uh, George?

634
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:53,694
与其用它给你代币
去买汽水，
Instead of using it to give you
tokens to get the sodas,

635
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,654
为什么不直接用机器
why don't you use the machine

636
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,198
给你汽水
而不用代币呢？
to give you sodas
without tokens?

637
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:01,827
- 嘿，谁问你了？
- 随便说说。
- Hey, who asked you?
- Just sayin', man.

638
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,495
来场比赛吧。
伙计们，来吧。
Let's have a game.
Guys, come on.

639
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:04,830
我不需要你的。
我的更好。
I don't need yours.
Mine's better.

640
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,039
- 发球前对打。
- 好的。
- Rally for serve.
- All right.

641
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,499
打到十分，行吗？
To ten, okay?

642
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,251
- 开始吧。
- 想得美。
- Let's start.
- Yeah, in your dreams.

643
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,545
哦！
Oh!

644
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:38,989
嘿，你们...
奶油用完了！
Hey, you're, uh...
you're out of half-n-half!

645
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,908
能在柜台
留个便条吗？
Can you leave
a note on the counter?

646
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,786
哦，来，
我帮你写。
Oh, here,
let me help you with that.

647
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,792
先是可口可乐，
然后是健怡可乐，零度可乐，
First there was Coke,
then Diet Coke, then Coke Zero,

648
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,252
现在我还得订购
and now I have
to order something

649
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:53,420
叫零糖可乐的东西。
called Coke Zero Sugar.

650
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:56,048
啊，晚期
资本主义，对吧？
Aw, late-stage
capitalism, right?

651
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,883
其实并非如此。
Actually, it's not.

652
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:01,637
消费主义无法用任何经济模型预测。
Consumerism stands apart from
any predictive economic model.

653
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,015
好吧，你说得对。
Yeah. Yeah, okay, sure.

654
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,392
虽然凯恩斯学派会反对这种说法，
I know Keynes
would say otherwise,

655
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:09,853
但稍有常识的人都明白
but anyone with half a mind
knows it's production,

656
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:11,772
推动经济的是生产而非消费。
not consumption,
that drives an economy.

657
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,858
但你显然比'稍有常识'强得多。
But you clearly have
more than half a mind.

658
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:17,027
当时我在摩加迪沙国立大学
I was three years
into my economics doctorate

659
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,196
攻读经济学博士第三年。
at Jaamacadda University
in Mogadishu.

660
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,907
2007年，青年党开始追杀我的家人。
In 2007, Al-Shabaab
came after my family.

661
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,117
我们不得不逃离。
We had to leave.

662
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:26,161
抱歉，那段日子一定很难熬。
Sorry. That must have been hard.

663
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,789
在肯尼亚难民营的两年确实艰难。
Two years in a refugee camp
in Kenya was hard, yes.

664
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:31,833
但现在来到缅因州，
But here, now, in Maine,

665
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:35,045
就像是重获新生。感谢真主。
it's like a new beginning.
Praise Allah.

666
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,922
也祝福你和你的兄弟。
Praise to you
and your brother too, man.

667
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,216
以后你们的咖啡都算我的。
The coffee is on us
from here on out.

668
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:40,759
晚安。
Have a good night.

669
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,178
谢谢。
Thank you.

670
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,538
过来，姑娘，快过来。
Come on, girl. Come on.

671
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,478
哦，嘿。
Oh, hey.

672
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:17,647
看看哪个白痴把这家伙
Look what some dipshit
tossed in the dumpster

673
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:20,150
扔在拉森五金店后面的垃圾箱里。
out behind Larson's Hardware.

674
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:24,571
这是六角手风琴，别跟普通手风琴搞混了。
It's a concertina, so don't go
mistaking it for an accordion.

675
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,530
我...我不会弄错的。
Oh, I-I won't.

676
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,576
我有个姐姐以前...
One of my sisters used to...

677
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,037
...会弹一点。
...play a little.

678
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,707
反正不是我。
Clearly not me.

679
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:39,252
但她也不可能告诉你
But she wouldn't have
been able to tell you

680
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:42,881
那个研究所的真实内幕。
about that Institute,
what they really do up there.

681
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:48,178
你就待在这儿别动。
You stay right here.

682
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:51,098
安妮！待在原地！
Stay there, Annie!

683
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:17,165
警察！趴在地上！
Police! Get down on the ground!

684
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:23,171
快点伙计！我们走！
Come on, man! Let's go!

685
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:30,804
快上车！关门！
Hurry up! Get in!
Close the door!

686
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,105
有枪声！
Shots fired!

687
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,649
多比拉兄弟加油站发生交火！
Shots fired!
Dobira Brothers' Gas Station!

688
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,236
至少一人中弹！
At least one down!

689
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,489
里面有便衣警察！
Uh, plainclothes
police officer inside!

690
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:51,241
多比拉先生，听得到吗？
Hey, hey, Mr. Dobira.

691
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:52,993
我是蒂姆。
It's Tim.

692
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,536
我是蒂姆，能听见吗？
It's Tim.
Can you hear me, man?

693
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,580
我得帮你翻身，好吗？
I'm gonna have
to turn you over, okay?

694
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:57,664
-不要
-必须翻过来检查
- No.
- I've gotta turn ya.

695
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,833
-我知道很疼
-太疼了
- I know, I know, I know.
- It hurts.

696
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,251
我知道很疼，忍一忍
I know that it hurts, okay?

697
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,335
必须检查伤势
I've just got to take
a look at you, buddy.

698
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:03,461
保持呼吸
Breathe for me.

699
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:09,050
把手给我，用力按住伤口
Here, give me your hands.
Put pressure on that, okay?

700
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,052
用力压住，我在这陪着你
Pressure on it.
I got you, man.

701
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,596
明白吗？继续按住伤口。
Okay? Keep pressure on it.

702
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,639
我马上回来。
我很快就回来，好吗？
I'll be right back.
I will be right back, okay?

703
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,810
您这里有酒精吗，
多比拉先生？
You got any alcohol,
Mr. Dobira?

704
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,563
酒精？
Alcohol?

705
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,481
没有？
No?

706
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,908
我来了。我来了。
我就在这儿。
I'm coming. I'm coming.
I'm right here.

707
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,827
我在这儿。我在这儿。
I'm right here. I'm right here.

708
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:38,163
让我看看伤势。
把手移开。
Let's see what we've got.
Move your hands for me.

709
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,456
把手拿开。
好的。
Move your hands.
Okay.

710
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:44,127
呼吸，深呼吸。
好样的。坚持住。
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
That's my man. Okay.

711
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,340
开始处理伤口。
会没事的。
Let's get it in there.
It's gonna be okay.

712
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,966
会好起来的。
救援马上到。
It's gonna be okay.
Help is coming.

713
00:41:56,389 --> 00:42:00,560
丹尼尔，又熬夜加班？
Daniel, burning
the midnight oil again?

714
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:03,188
嗯，准备明天的工作。
Uh, setting up for tomorrow.

715
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:07,067
我觉得再给艾尔斯先生
做一次梦境箱治疗就行。
I think we're one dream box
session away with Mr. Iles.

716
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,652
好消息。
Good news.

717
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,863
后续关键环节
都需要他参与。
We're gonna need him,
all the keyholes coming up.

718
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,448
我们会准备好的。
We'll be ready.

719
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,825
艾尔斯后面
还有几个对象...
Couple more
right behind Iles, so...

720
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,997
埃利斯那孩子怎么样？
What about the Ellis kid?

721
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:24,376
初步检测显示
他的TP值很低。
Well, his initial tests
indicate pretty low TP.

722
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,086
意料之中，
Not surprising,

723
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:29,047
毕竟BDNF水平一般，
但我们会让他达标的。
given his moderate BDNF levels,
but we'll get him there.

724
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,382
了解。
Good to know.

725
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,884
你应该也想到了，
Of course,
it must have occurred to you

726
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:36,388
即便是中等的
BDNF数值...
that even a moderate
BDNF score...

727
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:41,518
...配合埃利斯男孩
超群的智商，
...together with
the Ellis boy's superior IQ,

728
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,853
可能使他具有
独特价值。
might make him
uniquely valuable.

729
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:49,067
我的职责是激活
并提升他的TP值，
My job is to actuate
and invigorate his TP

730
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,111
直到能为蜂鸣计划
做出贡献。
to the point where he can
contribute to the Hum.

731
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,990
当然，丹尼尔。
这是我们共同的目标。
Of course, Daniel.
That's all our jobs.

732
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:59,077
但你也清楚，
某些情况下...
But you do know,
in certain cases,

733
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,248
受试者的真正价值...
可能远超预期...
our subject's true value...
an infinitely higher value...

734
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,292
另有他用。
might lie elsewhere.

735
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,751
呃...
Ah...

736
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,378
这个...
Uh...

737
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:11,047
别担心。
Don't worry.

738
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:13,049
这条走廊的麦克风
The microphones on this corridor

739
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:16,303
暂时故障了。
are experiencing
a temporary malfunction.

740
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:19,306
-斯塔克豪斯先生...
-叫我特雷弗就行。
- Mr. Stackhouse...
- Trevor, please.

741
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:24,227
特雷弗，我不知道
西格斯比跟你说了什么，
Trevor, look, I don't know
what Sigsby told you,

742
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:28,106
但我没有滥用职权
筛查PC患者。
but I'm not using
my position to scan for PCs.

743
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:31,359
这不仅超出了
我们目前的职责范围，
Not only is that outside
our mission purview now,

744
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:33,737
而且我很清楚
but I'm also very aware

745
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,490
有其他机构
专门负责此事。
that there are other
facilities so tasked.

746
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:38,575
说得好。
Well said.

747
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,827
完全是胡扯，
Complete bullshit,

748
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,871
不过说得漂亮。
but well said.

749
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,915
你说什么？
Excuse me?

750
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,715
没事的。别怕。
有我在呢。
It's okay. It's okay.
I got you, man.

751
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,383
我就在这儿。
I'm right here.

752
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:56,801
快点，快点。
Come on, come on.

753
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,140
快过来，快过来！
Come on, come on, come on.

754
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:20,033
举起手！让我看到你们的手！
Hands! I wanna see hands!

755
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:22,952
德鲁，我们需要叫救护车。
Drew, we need
an ambulance here, man.

756
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:25,080
- 德鲁，现在！
- 呃，什么...好吧，我们该...
- Drew, now!
- Uh, what... okay, what do we...

757
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,207
用你的对讲机。打给温蒂。
告诉她我们需要救护车。
Get on your radio. Call Wendy.
Tell her we need an ambulance.

758
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,000
腹部有枪伤。
Got a GSW to the stomach.

759
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:32,128
再让她发布全境通告
追查一辆吉普车，指南者型号，
And tell her we need an APB
on a Jeep, I think, um, Compass,

760
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:35,590
北卡罗来纳州车牌
前几位是WTB9。
North Carolina plate
starts with WTB9.

761
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,842
- 我只看到这些。
- 吉普车，呃...
- That's what I got.
- A Jeep, uh...

762
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:39,260
德鲁，叫救护车。
你能行的，兄弟。
Drew, ambulance, man.
You got this, bro.

763
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:41,429
呃-呃-呃，好的。温蒂，
Uh-Uh-Uh, yeah. Wendy,

764
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:43,181
我们需要派救护车
到多比拉家。
uh, we're gonna need an
ambulance to the Dobiras' place.

765
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:44,724
多比拉先生，呃...
Mr. Dobira, um...

766
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:46,267
已经在路上了...
15分钟到。
Already on the way...
15 minutes.

767
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:47,811
- 救护车在路上了。
- 全境通告。
- It's on the way.
- APB.

768
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:48,770
只有警长有权
发布全境通告。
Only Chief's supposed
to put out an APB.

769
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,647
就说是我他妈逼你发的。
Tell him I fucking forced you.

770
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,731
温蒂，我们还需要
发布全境通告...
Wendy, we're also
gonna need an APB...

771
00:44:51,815 --> 00:44:53,274
你能搞定，对吧？
You've got this, okay?

772
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:54,442
...追查一辆新款
吉普指南者。
...on a late-model
Jeep Cher... Compass.

773
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:56,861
我不会离开的。深呼吸。
I'm not going
anywhere. Breathe.

774
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:58,530
呃，北卡车牌！
Uh, NC plate!

775
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,199
- 北卡车牌！
- WTB9开头，后面还有三位。
- NC plates!
- WTB9, then three more.

776
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:04,119
车牌是WTB9。
Plates are WTB9.

777
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,412
- 呃，颜色？
- 呃，深色。我想...
- Uh, color?
- Uh, dark. I think...

778
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,330
应该是黑色。车上两人
I think black. Both guys in it

779
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:08,748
都是20岁左右的白人男性，
都携带武器。
were late teens, early 20s,
white, both armed.

780
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:10,208
呃-呃，车辆颜色深，
Uh-uh, vehicle's dark,

781
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,835
两名男性嫌疑人，白人，
20多岁，持械...
two male suspects, white,
20-something, armed...

782
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,837
救护车快到了。
保存体力。
Ambulance is coming.
Save your strength.

783
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,298
爸爸。爸爸。
Dad. Dad.

784
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:20,510
爸，我们选法比安娜是因为
她专业能力过硬。
Dad, we chose Fabienne because
she knows what she's doing.

785
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:22,846
记得她的患者评分吗？
Remember her patient ratings?

786
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:26,433
是啊，在护理机构里
是最高的。
Yeah, the highest
of any aide with the agency.

787
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:32,730
不。不，我不觉得
她会藏你的眼镜。
No. No, I don't think
she's hiding your glasses.

788
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:36,443
好吧。
Okay.

789
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,111
谢谢。
Thank you.

790
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,573
什么？哦！
What? Oh!

791
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:45,493
今年这个班
实在太棒了。
I have such
a terrific class this year.

792
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:50,123
真的，我觉得三年级
是最适合教学的年龄段。
Yeah, I really think third grade
is my favorite age to teach.

793
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:56,504
因为... 他们心智发展
特别迅速，
Because... Yeah, their minds
are developing so fast,

794
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:59,215
你能产生很大影响。
and you can have so much impact.

795
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:01,676
我们刚读完《时间的皱纹》，
We're finishing
A Wrinkle in Time,

796
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,637
孩子们简直爱不释手。
which, of course,
they can't get enough of.

797
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:06,723
我在想下学期
And I thought, next semester,

798
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:09,392
可以试试《幻象天堂》。
we'd try The Phantom Tollbooth.

799
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:12,854
为什么不呢？
Well, why not?

800
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,023
我九岁时
你给我读过这本书。
You read it to me
when I was nine.

801
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:18,902
我怎么可能忘记呢？
Well, because how
could I forget?

802
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:23,323
哦，好吧。
Oh, okay.

803
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,409
好的。
Okay.

804
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:27,952
爱你。
Love you.

805
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:38,296
西格斯比的唯一任务
Sigsby's only directive

806
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:41,424
就是确保传送带持续运转
is to keep
the conveyor belt moving,

807
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:43,134
始终领先于关键节点。
stay ahead of the keyholes.

808
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:44,385
没错。
Right.

809
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,179
但还有另一种视角
But there's another perspective,

810
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:48,556
我想这正是你我共识
one, I think, you and I share,

811
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,226
这个视角着眼于
and that perspective takes in

812
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:54,103
那些具有真正PC潜质者
the almost incalculable value

813
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:56,606
无可估量的价值
of identifying individuals

814
00:46:56,689 --> 00:47:00,026
识别这类人才意义重大
with genuine PC potential.

815
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:04,948
你我或许都认同这个大局观
You and I may share
that larger perspective.

816
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,741
但据西格斯比所说
But I understand from Sigsby

817
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,993
研究所集团并不认同
that the Institute Group
does not,

818
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:10,828
至少对我们的工作如此
at least as far
as the work we do.

819
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:12,622
她这话说得太他妈对了
She's sure as shit right
about that.

820
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,479
等等 你是说有第三方势力？
Wait. Are you saying
there's a third party?

821
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:38,439
不止一个第三方
Not a third party.

822
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,316
多股势力
Multiple.

823
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,696
他们都愿意砸下天文数字
All willing to funnel
astronomical sums of money

824
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,864
给任何能提供这种
to whoever can provide them

825
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:49,909
战略优势的人
with that kind
of competitive advantage.

826
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:53,329
那我该怎么做？
So... what do I do?

827
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:56,416
继续你现在的工作
Exactly what you've been doing...

828
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:59,002
发掘具有PC潜质的孩子
find a kid with potential
for PC development

829
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,670
然后培养他
and develop him.

830
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:02,422
你是指埃利斯？
Ellis, you mean?

831
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:04,549
这要由你来判断 博士
You tell me, Doc.

832
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:07,302
识别和培养是你的专长
Identifying and developing,
that's your department.

833
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,511
啊
Ah.

834
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:12,557
我只是提供工作空间
All I'm offering is room
for you to work.

835
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,600
还有买家
And a buyer.

836
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,313
西格斯比怎么办？
And what about Sigsby?

837
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:19,731
她怎么了？
What about her?

838
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:23,192
建议你管好枕边风
I'd say watch your pillow talk,

839
00:48:23,276 --> 00:48:26,738
不过她应该不爱闲聊
but I can't imagine
she's much for talk.

840
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:31,367
明天见 医生
I'll see you tomorrow, Doctor.

841
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,549
-左边？
-好的
- Left side?
- Okay.

842
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:51,554
-这里
-准备好了？
- Here.
- Ready?

843
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:53,056
-好 二 三
-起
- Okay. Two, three.
- Up.

844
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,474
必须保护好现场
You need to keep
the scene secure

845
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:57,435
等班戈的鉴证组赶来
until the CSI team
gets here from Bangor.

846
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:58,895
预计他们很快会到
I'm supposed to get
an ETA shortly.

847
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:01,689
该死
Damn it.

848
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,734
多比拉先生没事吧？
Mr. Dobira gonna be okay?

849
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:07,945
急救员暂时稳住了伤势
EMTs have him stabilized
for now.

850
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:11,741
他至今运气不错 希望能保持
He's been awful lucky so far.
Let's hope it holds.

851
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:14,535
不只是运气好 长官
支援来得很快
Not just luck, sir.
Help arrived pretty quick.

852
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:20,750
干得好 德鲁
Nice job, Drew.

853
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,126
谢谢 警长
Thank you, Chief.

854
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,462
通缉令也发得很及时
With the APB, too.

855
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,756
消息传得够快
州警能在州际公路
Word got out quick enough,
the Staties could run roadblocks

856
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:28,675
双向设下路障
both ways on the interstate.

857
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:31,969
他们觉得已经把那帮混蛋逼入绝境了
They figured they've got
the assholes cornered.

858
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:35,306
我该去录口供了
好写报告
Well, I should, uh, tape up
so I can start my report.

859
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:39,477
你也是 蒂姆
Yours, too, Tim.

860
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,813
你得确保所有细节都准确无误
You wanna be sure you get
all the details right.

861
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:44,190
今晚还有几家要走访 头儿
Got a few more doors
to get to tonight, boss.

862
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,275
明早交报告行吗
Okay, if I give it to you
in the morning?

863
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,486
别忘了写上
Just don't forget
to include the part

864
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:51,864
你赤手空拳赶跑两个持枪劫匪那段
where you chased off two
armed robbers with no weapon.

865
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:05,503
- 谢了
- 不 你太棒了
- Thank you.
- Nah, you were great.

866
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,338
不 我表现很差
No, I wasn't.

867
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,218
但下次记得带尿布和凡士林 谁知道呢
But next time,
diapers and Vaseline. Who knew?

868
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:15,513
下次一定
Next time.

869
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,665
