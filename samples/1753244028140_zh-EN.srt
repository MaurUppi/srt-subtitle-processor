Um, I just wanted to get some
feedback on your first date

18
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,237
感觉如何
with my client Sophie.

19
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,832
其实我现在正要去见她...
I'm actually on my way
to meet her right now...

20
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:42,867
不过今早我们简单聊过...
but I had a quick chat
with her this morning...

21
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:45,439
总体反馈很好
and the headline is, she had a great time

22
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,445
她希望能再见你
and would love to see you again.

23
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,515
喂？詹姆斯？
Hello? James?

24
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:55,046
詹姆斯：我想退出你们的服务。
JAMES: Yeah, I'd like to be
taken off the service.

25
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,915
能问问原因吗？
May I ask why?

26
00:05:58,018 --> 00:05:59,616
詹姆斯：你们承诺介绍的是。
JAMES: I thought you were
going to set me up

28
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:06,424
我说过要30多岁
身材匀称笑容甜美的。
I said: a fit woman in her 30s
with a nice smile.

29
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:08,859
她40岁还胖
She's 40 and fat.

30
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:11,766
- 她39岁- 39就是40岁。
- She's 39.
- 39 is not 30s, that's 40.

31
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:15,033
这种女人我根本不会右滑。
I would never swipe right
on a woman like that.

32
00:06:16,972 --> 00:06:19,444
- 很遗憾你这么想- (挂断音)。
- I'm sorry you feel that way.

(轻笑)

36
00:06:36,391 --> 00:06:38,222
露西你太棒了
You did it, Lucy.

37
00:06:38,324 --> 00:06:42,632
当你说他47岁
年薪才15万的时候...
When you said that he's 47
and only makes 150K a year...

38
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:47,098
我差点拒绝 还好相信了你。
I almost said no, but I'm
really happy I trusted you.

39
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:49,537
虽然才第一次约会。
I know it's only been one date

40
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,971
我知道不该期望太高...
and I need to manage my expectations...

41
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:56,041
但这绝对是我经历过
最棒的初次约会！
but this is probably the best
first date I've ever had!

42
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:59,918
呃 苏菲 我刚和他通过电话。
Uh, Sophie, so I just got off
the phone with him.

43
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,316
他很享受和你的约会。
And he loved meeting you,

44
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:04,387
玩得很开心...
he had a great time...

45
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:06,123
但他觉得目前
But he doesn't feel like the chemistry

46
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,427
两人之间缺少火花。
is there for him at this time.

47
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:10,462
所以
So.

48
00:07:12,394 --> 00:07:13,993
继续寻找吧
Onward and upward.

49
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,799
他不想第二次约会？
He doesn't want a second date?

50
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:19,966
是的
No.

51
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,238
他都秃顶了。
（轻声笑）
He's balding. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

52
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,340
他哪来的胆子？
How fucking dare he?

53
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:28,046
露西：约会就是场冒险。
LUCY: Dating is a risk.

54
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:31,978
你敢于冒险，这很勇敢。
You took a risk. It's brave.

55
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,849
苏菲：为什么给我介绍这种人？
SOPHIE: Why did you set me up
with someone like that?

56
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,721
他符合我们列出的很多条件...
He checked a lot of our boxes...

57
00:07:39,654 --> 00:07:41,526
你也符合他的很多要求。
and you checked a lot of his.

58
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:44,425
所以，继续向前看吧。
So, onwards and upwards.

59
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:45,624
来聊聊你的下一个相亲对象。
Let's talk about your next match.

60
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:47,429
有个超棒的男士介绍给你。
I have an amazing guy for you.

61
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:50,133
他叫马克，是位医生，
His name is Mark, he's a doctor,

62
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:51,368
长得非常英俊...
he's very handsome...

63
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,005
头发浓密，48岁。
he has a full head of hair, he's 48.

64
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,106
苏菲：都快50了。
SOPHIE: That's almost 50.

65
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,539
以48岁来说状态很好。
He looks great for 48.

66
00:07:57,641 --> 00:08:00,506
身材保持得不错，看着像40岁。
He's very fit. He looks like he's 40.

67
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:03,142
- 多高？
- 1米8。
- How tall?
- 5'11".。

68
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:07,579
是真有1米8还是虚报成1米8的
实际1米75？
Is he actually 5'11" or is he
actually 5'9" and is lying?

69
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:09,551
差个几厘米有什么关系？
What's a couple of inches?

70
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:12,255
苏菲：我不想浪费时间。
SOPHIE: I don't want to waste my time.

71
00:08:12,357 --> 00:08:15,018
我没指望出现奇迹。
I am not asking for a miracle.

72
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,996
只求最基本的条件。
I'm just asking for the bare minimum.

73
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,392
我已经在降低标准了。
I'm trying to settle.

74
00:08:20,494 --> 00:08:22,397
露西：苏菲。
LUCY: Sophie.

75
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:24,569
我理解你现在的心情。
I know how it feels right now.

76
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:27,198
但我向你保证...
But I promise you...

77
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:31,840
你会嫁给此生挚爱。
you're going to marry
the love of your life.

78
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:34,472
苏菲：我不信。
SOPHIE: I don't believe you.

79
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:35,910
没关系。
That's okay.

80
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,275

responsible for now, Lucy?

如果女方要求
that if the girl asks for

找个一米八的高个子...

It took our membership team
an hour to get her to renew.

110
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,346
没救了
Hopeless.

111
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:24,815
恐怕整个纽约都找不到。
I'm afraid there's not
a single man in New York City

112
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,317
愿意和她约会的男人。
that'll date this girl.

113
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,891
问题出在哪里？
What seems to be the issue?

114
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:31,525
问题就在她太普通了。
That's the thing. There is
nothing wrong with her.

115
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:34,763
长相还行...
She's okay attractive...

116
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:39,701
收入还行，学历还行，性格还行。
okay money, okay educated,
okay personality.

117
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:43,037
就是没有突出亮点。
There's just not a standout quality.

118
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:45,410
她在主流婚恋市场缺乏竞争力...
She's not competitive
in the mainstream market...

119
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,505
又找不到细分市场。
and there is no niche market for her.

120
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:48,776
没错
Exactly.

121
00:10:48,878 --> 00:10:50,240
如果没有独特卖点...
And if there's no specialty appeal...

122
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:52,742
在任何市场都找不到定位。
then there's no place
for her in any market.

123
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:54,584
确实棘手
That is tough.

124
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:57,719
可她是我现在最爱的客户。
And she's my favorite client right now.

125
00:10:57,821 --> 00:10:59,783
虽然和其他人一样挑剔。
I mean, she's entitled like everyone,

126
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:02,020
但她很贴心...
but she's sweet...

127
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:06,625
而且现实理智，不疯癫。
and she's realistic, she's not crazy.

128
00:11:06,727 --> 00:11:08,425
是个好姑娘
She's a nice girl.

129
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:11,830
总该有个男人
There's got to be a guy out there

130
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:14,138
就想找个好姑娘吧。
who just wants a nice girl.

131
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,872
马克·P怎么样？
What about Mark P.?

132
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:17,607
普普通通
He's okay.

133
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,807
露西：已经给她推荐过了。
LUCY: I pitched him to her already.

134
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:22,645
她怀疑他身高不到1米8。
She's afraid he's not actually 5'11".

135
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:23,942
我说现在能不能别纠结。
And I'm like, can we please not worry

136
00:11:24,044 --> 00:11:25,175
这几厘米的差距？
about a couple inches right now?

137
00:11:25,277 --> 00:11:27,182
毕竟你快孤独终老了。
Because you're about to die alone.

138

(轻笑)
(CHUCKLES)

139
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,249
知道吗 这个可以做手术。
You know there's a surgery for that.

140
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:33,157
治孤独终老？
For dying alone?

141
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,990
是增高手术
For getting taller.

142
00:11:35,624 --> 00:11:37,724
最多能长15厘米。
Up to six inches.

143
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:40,025
把腿骨打断...
You break your legs, and...

144
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:43,828
拉伸后让骨头自然愈合。
extend it, let the bone heal itself.

145
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,203
这能改变人生
That's a game changer.

146
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,333
费用要20万美金。
It costs like 200K.

147
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:52,469
15厘米能让男人身价翻倍。
Six inches can double
a man's value in the market.

148
00:11:53,742 --> 00:11:54,974
如果负担得起
If you can afford it,

149
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:57,045
绝对值得投资
it's definitely worth the investment.

150
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,979
那句话怎么说来着？
What's the saying?

"You're not ugly,
you just don't have money."

你选好婚礼穿的裙子了吗？
Do you have a dress
picked out for the wedding?

155
00:12:09,226 --> 00:12:10,223
选好了。

要我帮你介绍对象吗？
Do you want me to set you up with someone?

161
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,005
不用，我打算孤独终老。
No, I'm gonna die alone.

162

彼得和夏尔是我的理想伴侣...
that Peter and Char are my couple goals...

我也要找到属于自己的彼得。
and I need to find my own Peter

这事得怪你？
and you're responsible?

180
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:23,466
是我撮合了夏洛特和彼得，明白吗？
Well, I'm how Charlotte

181
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:24,767
但建立牢固的感情...
But it's up to the client

00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:36,339
(轻声笑)哪有什么行业机密。
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
There are no industry secrets.

188

我们随时都可能在现实生活中。

又不是说我要结婚。
It's not like I'm getting married

自从有人类婚姻开始就是如此。
since the very first time
two people did it.

如果交易不划算，你随时可以退出。

or wrong or crazy to me.

谁都不能说。这事太糟糕了。
Not a soul. It is so awful.

She's never said that,
but I know it's true.

我觉得这是世界上最难的事。
I find it to be the most
difficult thing in the world.

329

00:30:51,713 --> 00:30:53,180
那破房子都快散架了。
It's falling apart.

457
00:30:53,848 --> 00:30:55,446
我从来用不上热水。
I never get hot water.

458
00:30:56,984 --> 00:30:58,955
露西：你室友们怎么样？
LUCY: How are your roommates?

459
00:31:00,187 --> 00:31:02,185
大卫搬去和未婚妻住了...
David moved in with his fiancee...

460
00:31:02,287 --> 00:31:04,657
我觉得洛根现在
and I think Logan is developing

461
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:06,022
酗酒成瘾了。
a drinking problem.

462
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:07,625
露西：大卫订婚了？
LUCY: David is engaged?

463
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:08,926
对啊。
Yeah.

464
00:31:09,028 --> 00:31:10,594
露西：和那个抖音女孩？
LUCY: To the TikTok girl?

465
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:11,830
没错。
Yep.

466
00:31:11,932 --> 00:31:14,267
她现在还搞OnlyFans。
She does OnlyFans now too.

467
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,734
他赚到了。
Good for him.

468
00:31:16,836 --> 00:31:18,338
约翰：是吗？
JOHN: Is it?

469
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,038
他是个身高1米7、从没出版过作品
的抑郁小说家。
He's a 5'7" depressed novelist
who's never been published.

470
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,639
他找不到更好的了。
He couldn't do better.

471
00:31:29,752 --> 00:31:31,284
就这么简单？
It's that simple, huh?

472
00:31:32,886 --> 00:31:34,353
这是明摆着的事。
It's just math.

473
00:31:38,993 --> 00:31:40,458
你在想什么？
What are you thinking about?

474
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:44,297
味道还是老样子。
It smells the same.

475
00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:46,530
约翰：什么，我的车？
JOHN: What, my car?

476
00:31:48,504 --> 00:31:49,500
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

477
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,437
- 看那边！
- 我才不花25美元。
- Look, there!
- I'm not going to pay $25

478
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,439
停这破车一小时。
to park this piece of shit for an hour.

479
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,046
这已经是最低价了。
That's the cheapest we'll ever get.

480
00:31:59,148 --> 00:32:00,676
下个街区能找到路边停车位。
We'll find street parking
on the next block.

481
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:02,781
约翰，都20分钟了。我来付钱吧。
John, it's been 20 minutes.
I'll just pay for it.

482
00:32:02,883 --> 00:32:04,217
不用你付。
You're not paying.

483
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:05,719
- 我们只能...
- 这些该死的...
- We're going to have to...
- These fucking people...

484
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:06,987
如果迟到超过15分钟。
forfeit the reservation

485
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:08,452
预订就作废了
if we're more than 15 minutes late

486
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:09,755
他们还要收我们
and then they charge us
a cancellation fee of

487
00:32:09,857 --> 00:32:10,890
每人25美元的取消费。
$25 per person.

488
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:12,254
等等，你是认真的吗？
Wait, are you fucking serious?

489
00:32:12,356 --> 00:32:13,664
我都跟你说过十遍了。
I told you this like 10 times.

490
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:14,995
这简直是敲诈。
你怎么会订
That's extortion. Why would you make

491
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:16,260
这种黑店的位置？
a reservation at such a criminal place?

492
00:32:16,362 --> 00:32:17,400
我们说好纪念日
We agreed to go to nice restaurants

493
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,069
要去高档餐厅的。
on our anniversary.

494
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:20,630
纽约哪有"高档"餐厅不...
Oh, there's no "nice" places
in New York City that won't...

495
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:22,264
迟到几分钟就收50美元的？
charge you 50 bucks if you're
a couple minutes late?

496
00:32:22,366 --> 00:32:23,873
我们干嘛要开车来？
Why did we even bring the car?

497
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,074
对，都怪我排练拖堂了。
Yes, it's my fault, my rehearsal ran long.

498
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:27,504
- 你表达得很清楚了。
- 我们本可以叫车的。
- You made your point.
- We could've called a car.

499
00:32:27,606 --> 00:32:29,780
然后花50美元进城...
So we could spend $50
to get into the city...

500
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:31,344
再在餐厅消费200美元？
and then another $200 at the restaurant?

501
00:32:31,446 --> 00:32:34,010
约翰 你连停车费都付不起
干嘛还要开车？
Why do you have a car
if you can't pay for it, John?

502
00:32:34,112 --> 00:32:35,512
看 就在那儿
Look, right there.

503
00:32:35,614 --> 00:32:38,182
40分钟20美元？
这他妈是什么计价方式？
$20 for 40 minutes?
What the fuck is this math?

504
00:32:38,284 --> 00:32:39,888
我不想在纪念日
I don't want to fight about money

505
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,789
和男朋友为钱吵架。
with my boyfriend on our anniversary.

506
00:32:41,892 --> 00:32:43,020
这让我感觉像在重蹈父母的覆辙。
It makes me feel like my parents.

507
00:32:43,122 --> 00:32:44,453
约翰：对不起行了吧？
JOHN: I'm sorry, okay?

508
00:32:44,555 --> 00:32:46,627
看到下一个停车场我们就停。
We'll park at the next garage we see.

509
00:32:46,729 --> 00:32:47,725
你要干什么？
What are you doing?

510
00:32:47,827 --> 00:32:49,126
露西
Lucy.

511
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:50,429
你他妈要去哪儿？
Where the fuck are you going?

512
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:53,836
嘿 我错了还不行吗？
真的对不起
Hey, I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.

513
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:58,006
我身上没钱而且我忘了。
I don't have any money, and I forgot.

514
00:32:58,108 --> 00:33:00,943
什么？忘了什么？
忘了你爱我吗？
What? What did you forget?
That you love me?

515
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,143
能请你回到车里吗？
求你了？
Will you please get back
in the car? Please?

516
00:33:03,246 --> 00:33:05,641
我不想因为贫穷而厌恶你...
I don't want to hate you
because you're poor...

517
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:08,643
但此刻我就是这样这让我更厌恶自己。
but right now I do,
and it makes me hate myself.

518
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:12,286
你知道让你开心有多难吗？
Do you know how hard it is
to make you happy?

519
00:33:12,388 --> 00:33:15,618
而我想要你快乐我在努力 真的。
And I want you to be happy.
I'm trying. I really am.

520
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,088
我知道 这份心意
几乎就足以让我快乐了。
I know. And it's almost enough
to make me happy.

521
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,624
(汽车喇叭轰鸣)。
(HORNS BLARING)

522
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:24,801
多希望我不在乎
五周年纪念日吃路边摊...
I wish that I didn't care
if we ate from a halal cart...

523
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:27,665
可我就是会在意
on our five-year anniversary, but I do.

524
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:32,409
不管你有多恨我我保证我更恨自己。
And however much you hate me,
I promise, I hate myself more.

525
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:33,474
我不恨你
I don't hate you.

526
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:34,572
你恨的
You do.

527
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,081
这不是因为我们不相爱。
And it's not because we're not in love.

528
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,018
是因为我们太穷了。
It's because we're broke.

529
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,714
(引擎空转轰鸣)。
(ENGINE IDLING LOUDLY)

530
00:33:48,219 --> 00:33:50,456

533
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,582
要上来坐坐吗？
You want to come up?

534
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:24,556
想
Yes.

535
00:34:27,026 --> 00:34:28,230
但不行
But I shouldn't.

536
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,764
谢谢送我回来
Thanks for the ride.

537
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:38,537
约翰：随时效劳
JOHN: Anytime.

538
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,610
记得邀请我看你演出。
Invite me to your play.

539
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:47,447
一定
I will.

(门轴吱呀作响)。
(DOOR CREAKS)

(引擎启动伴随刺耳声)。
(ENGINE STARTS, SCREECHING)

542
00:35:04,968 --> 00:35:06,199
我只是给你些反馈。
I'm just giving you feedback

543
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:07,597
这样你才能提升服务质量...
so you can improve your performance...

544
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:09,337
我也能匹配到更优质的对象。
and I can start getting better matches.

545
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:11,405
我想找个集齐
I want to meet someone
who is a combination of all

546
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:14,206
前四位匹配对象所有优点的人。
the different awesome parts
of the last four matches.

547
00:35:14,308 --> 00:35:16,911
要像苏菲那样的职业和教育背景。
Sophie's job and education level,

548
00:35:17,013 --> 00:35:19,509
艾米丽的身材和生活品质。
Emily's body and lifestyle,

549
00:35:19,611 --> 00:35:22,645
派珀的容貌和时尚品味...
Piper's face and sense of style...

550
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:26,956
还要有简那样的兴趣爱好
和电视剧口味
and Jane's hobbies and taste in TV shows.

551
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:30,285
很简单，
毕竟我可是弗兰肯斯坦博士。
Easy, since I'm Dr. Frankenstein.

552
00:35:30,387 --> 00:35:31,590
(紧张地笑)
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

553
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:34,790
再过几个月我就48岁了。
I'm turning 48 in a few months

554
00:35:34,892 --> 00:35:37,997
我觉得需要找个更成熟的对象。
and I think I need
to meet someone more grown.

555
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:39,365
能和我聊得来的，
Someone I can talk to,

556
00:35:39,468 --> 00:35:42,466
最好是懂欣赏音乐、
just a proper woman
who knows good music...

557
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:46,207
看过老电影的得体女性...
诸如此类。
has seen old movies, things like that.

558
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:49,110
之前交往的女友都是21、24岁...
My last couple girlfriends
were 21 and 24...

559
00:35:49,212 --> 00:35:52,246
说实话她们有点幼稚。
and they were honestly kind of immature.

560
00:35:52,348 --> 00:35:54,382
(轻声笑)我能想象。
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
I can imagine it might be

561
00:35:54,484 --> 00:35:58,448
和00后女孩相处可能不太容易。
a little hard to relate
to girls born in the 2000s.

562
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,690
我有个非常特别的客户，
I have a really special client,

563
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,157
叫索菲...
her name is Sophie...

564
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,920
她是事业有成的律师，39岁。
she's a highly
accomplished lawyer, she's 39.

565
00:36:05,926 --> 00:36:07,494
呃...
Um...

566
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:12,066
其实我没考虑30多岁的。
I wasn't really thinking 30s.

567
00:36:12,168 --> 00:36:13,296
露西：所以你说要年长些...
LUCY: So when you said older...

568
00:36:13,398 --> 00:36:15,535
我指的是27、28岁左右。
I meant more like 27, 28.

569
00:36:16,002 --> 00:36:17,237
露西：啊。
LUCY: Ah.

570
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:19,071
30多岁的女性
It gets really intense and complicated

571
00:36:19,173 --> 00:36:20,140
关系会变得特别复杂。
with women in their 30s.

572
00:36:20,242 --> 00:36:22,144
她们期望值很高
They have really high expectations

573
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,110
而且总急着推进关系，
and they tend to rush things
because I guess,

574
00:36:24,213 --> 00:36:26,480
可能是生物钟在倒计时吧。
their biological clock's ticking.

575
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:30,848
我还有个很美的客户，31岁——。
I have another really
beautiful client, she's 31--

576
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,914
呃。
Uh.

577
00:36:33,216 --> 00:36:34,689
不要。
No.

578
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:37,524
最好是...27岁。
Someone... 27.

579
00:36:38,456 --> 00:36:40,327
29岁都算极限了。
Even 29 is pushing it.

580
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,031
相信我——这对大家都好。
Trust me-- it's the best thing
for everyone.

581
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,667
我和20多岁的女孩。
I genuinely get along much better

582
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:44,861
相处确实更融洽。
with girls in their 20s.

583
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:49,434
不在乎性格或生活方式...
I don't care what she's like
or how she lives...

584
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,074
只要外形符合我的审美。
I just care that she's my type physically.

585
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,135
露西：你对外形有什么要求？
LUCY: What's your type physically?

586
00:36:54,237 --> 00:36:55,410
身材匀称。
Fit.

587
00:36:56,044 --> 00:36:57,247
露西：就这？
LUCY: Just fit?

588
00:36:57,948 --> 00:37:00,316
体脂率20以下。
Fit. Nothing over 20 BMI.

589
00:37:00,915 --> 00:37:02,285
好吧。
Okay.

590
00:37:05,455 --> 00:37:08,584
谢谢你答应和我约会。
Thank you for agreeing
to come on a date with me.

591
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:09,992
露西：我只是想让你明白。
LUCY: Well, I only said yes to this

592
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:11,325
你的想法是错的...
so you'd realize you're wrong...

593
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:12,754
其实你对我没兴趣。
and you're not actually interested in me.

594
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:15,063
哈里：我的直觉通常很准。
HARRY: My instincts are usually right.

595
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:16,328
你觉得你比专业人士。
You think that you're more right

596
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,860
更懂这个？
about this than a professional?

597
00:37:17,962 --> 00:37:21,034
哦当然你是专家，但我相信直觉。
Oh, sure, you're the expert,
but I trust my gut.

598
00:37:21,136 --> 00:37:24,203
露西：行啊，走着瞧。
LUCY: Okay. We'll see.

599
00:37:24,305 --> 00:37:26,243
你今天很美。
You look really good today.

600
00:37:30,945 --> 00:37:32,180
谢谢。
Thanks.

601
00:37:32,282 --> 00:37:34,284
露西：每周喝多少酒？
LUCY: How many drinks per week?

602
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:39,350
看情况，大概8到10杯？
工作压力大难免会喝。
Depends, but like, 8? 10?
Work makes it hard not to.

603
00:37:39,452 --> 00:37:41,720
- 你吸毒吗？
- 从不。
- Do you do drugs?
- Never.

604
00:37:43,223 --> 00:37:45,022
派对上会抽大麻。
I do pot at parties.

605
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:46,255
我也是。
Me too.

606
00:37:46,357 --> 00:37:48,298
所以不是从不。
So not never.

607
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,893
嗯。
Hmm.

608
00:37:50,995 --> 00:37:53,501
你觉得你最好看的身体部位是？
What do you think is your
best physical feature?

609
00:37:55,103 --> 00:37:56,471
我的眼睛还不错。
My eyes aren't bad.

610
00:38:04,578 --> 00:38:07,512
你是怎么入行的？
How did you end up doing what you do?

611
00:38:07,614 --> 00:38:09,544
我父母都在金融行业工作...
Both my parents work in finance...

612
00:38:09,646 --> 00:38:10,746
我哥哥也是，
and so does my brother,

613
00:38:10,848 --> 00:38:12,453
所以我就顺其自然地做了这行。
so I just kind of ended up doing it.

614
00:38:12,555 --> 00:38:14,390
我们都在我母亲创立的公司工作。
And we all work for
the firm my mother started.

615
00:38:15,953 --> 00:38:18,890
- 这是家族企业。
- 是啊，挺无聊的。
- It's a family business.
- Yeah, it's boring.

616
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:20,162
嗯。
Mm.

617
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:21,991
你是怎么开始现在的工作的？
How did you get into doing what you do?

618
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:28,365
这是...我第一份也是（轻笑）唯一。
It was the... first
and (CHUCKLES) only thing

619
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:29,768
真正擅长的事。
I was really good at.

620
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,141
哈里：你还想了解我什么？
HARRY: What else do you want
to know about me?

621
00:38:33,243 --> 00:38:34,537
我打赌你父母从没。
I bet your parents never raised

622
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,412
对彼此大声嚷嚷过。
their voices at each other.

623
00:38:37,311 --> 00:38:38,510
几乎从没有过。
I think almost never.

624
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:40,515
也许他们只是偷偷吵架。
Maybe they were secretly fighting.

625
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,947
他们为钱吵过架吗？
Did they ever fight about money?

626
00:38:44,853 --> 00:38:45,850
没有。
No.

627
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:47,885
有道理。
Makes sense.

628
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:51,757
我觉得我们会模仿父母的吵架方式。
I think we emulate the way
our parents fight.

629
00:38:52,157 --> 00:38:53,627
嗯。
Hmm.

630
00:38:53,729 --> 00:38:55,064
在纽约看到情侣当街吵架。
I see couples fighting
in the middle of the street

631
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,696
我总是不理解。
in New York and I don't get it.

632
00:38:56,798 --> 00:38:59,435
他们不觉得在公众场合这样很丢脸吗？
Aren't they embarrassed to do
that in front of people?

633
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:03,934
我就是那种会当街吵架的人。
I'm the type to fight
in the middle of the street.

634
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:07,206
- 是吗？
- 是啊。
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

635
00:39:07,308 --> 00:39:08,609
你这样做过吗？
Have you ever done that?

636
00:39:10,675 --> 00:39:12,841
- 从没有。
- (轻声笑)
- Never.
- (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

637
00:39:12,943 --> 00:39:14,412
苏菲：你觉得他会喜欢我吗？
SOPHIE: Do you think he will like me?

638
00:39:14,515 --> 00:39:15,944
我觉得你会很喜欢他。
I think you will really like him.

639
00:39:16,047 --> 00:39:18,713
- 你确定？
- 保持开放心态。（笑）
- Are you sure?
- Stay open-minded. (LAUGHS)

640
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:20,988
- 我好紧张。
- 放轻松。
- I'm so nervous.
- All right.

641
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,224
结束后给我发消息。
Okay, text me after

642
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,588
- 我明天给你打电话。
- 好的。
- and I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay.

643
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,222
- 好的，晚点聊，苏菲。再见。
- 再见。
- Okay, talk soon, Sophie. Bye.
- Bye.

644
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:26,557
- 嗨。
- 嗨。
- Hi.
- Hi.

645
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:28,629
- 哇，谢谢。
- (轻声笑)
- Wow. Thank you.
- (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

646
00:39:29,263 --> 00:39:30,466
不客气。
You're welcome.

647
00:39:32,066 --> 00:39:33,402
你还好吗？
You okay?

648
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,904
没事。我的客户现在也在约会。
Yes. My client is going
on a date right now too.

649
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,106
你看起来很紧张。
You seem nervous.

650
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,570
我真的很希望她喜欢这个男生。
I really want her to like this guy.

651
00:39:38,672 --> 00:39:40,372
她已经连续约会失败十次了。
She's had, like, 10 bad dates in a row

652
00:39:40,474 --> 00:39:42,044
我这次必须得给她找个靠谱的。
and I just need to deliver.

653
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,377
你是因为即将开始完美约会。
Are you feeling guilty that

654
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:45,382
而感到愧疚吗？
you're about to go on a good date?

655
00:39:46,181 --> 00:39:48,016
（露西轻笑）
(LUCY CHUCKLES)

656
00:39:48,118 --> 00:39:50,317
（模糊的交谈声）
(FAINT INDISTINCT CHATTER)

657
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:51,716
露西：我不确定是喜欢你。
LUCY: I don't know if I like you

658
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:54,350
还是单纯喜欢你带我去的地方。
or if I just like the places
you take me to.

659
00:39:54,452 --> 00:39:55,551
你喜欢我？
You like me?

660
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:57,756
什么时候的事？
When did that happen?

661
00:39:57,858 --> 00:40:00,225
大概是从看你买单的姿势开始的。
I think when I saw the way
you pick up the bill.

662
00:40:00,327 --> 00:40:01,527
（轻声笑）
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

663
00:40:01,629 --> 00:40:03,226
哈利：我这动作很帅吧？
HARRY: I do it really well, don't I?

664
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,868
确实帅
You do.

665
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,129
行云流水一气呵成。
Just one swift motion.

666
00:40:08,435 --> 00:40:11,133
没有犹豫 毫不怯场。
No hesitation. No fear.

667
00:40:11,235 --> 00:40:14,070
哈利：反正我付得起 有什么好怕的。
HARRY: Well, I can afford it,
so why would I be scared?

668
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:17,246
你在我身上投资不少啊？
You're investing a lot in me, huh?

669
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:20,680
我只是想让约会更有情调。
I just want our dates to be romantic.

670
00:40:20,782 --> 00:40:24,520
餐费价格决定约会情调？
How expensive a meal is
makes the date romantic?

671
00:40:25,153 --> 00:40:26,181
难道不是吗？
Doesn't it?

672
00:40:30,588 --> 00:40:33,463
初次见面时你说...
When we first met...

673
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:36,330
你的工作让你活得像个殡葬师。
you said your job makes you
think like a mortician

674
00:40:36,432 --> 00:40:38,699
或是保险理赔员
or an insurance claims adjuster.

675
00:40:39,433 --> 00:40:41,097
那我作为尸体合格吗？
How am I as a corpse?

676
00:40:42,302 --> 00:40:43,836
优质尸体
A good corpse.

677
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:46,271
那作为理赔金呢？
How about as a payout?

678
00:40:46,373 --> 00:40:48,043
（轻声笑）
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

679
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,242
无可挑剔
Couldn't ask for better.

680
00:40:49,344 --> 00:40:50,942
作为养老院伴侣呢？
As a nursing home partner?

681
00:40:53,148 --> 00:40:54,550
墓友如何？
A grave buddy?

682
00:41:01,257 --> 00:41:03,086
你能找到比我更好的。
You can do better than me.

683
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:05,525
真的吗？
Can I?

684
00:41:05,627 --> 00:41:07,926
你心里其实算过这笔账吧？
You know how to do the math, don't you?

685
00:41:10,629 --> 00:41:12,928
以我的职业经历...
In my line of work...

686
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,399
见过无数优质男性。
I meet hundreds of highly desirable,

687
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:16,902
条件都相当出色...
high quality men...

688
00:41:17,004 --> 00:41:21,637
但你是业内所谓的"独角兽"。
but you are what we call
in my industry "a unicorn."

689
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:24,345
近乎幻想的完美存在。
An impossible fantasy.

690
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:25,945
你哥哥也是独角兽。
Your brother was a unicorn, too.

691
00:41:26,047 --> 00:41:29,184
我的客户不愿降低标准。
The reason my clients cannot
lower their expectations...

692
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,451
正是因为即便概率渺茫。
is because, against all odds,

693
00:41:31,553 --> 00:41:33,850
像你这样的男人确实存在。
men like you do actually exist.

694
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,020
我肯定有什么致命缺陷。
Well, I'm sure something is wrong with me.

695
00:41:38,326 --> 00:41:39,892
你完美无缺
You're perfect.

696
00:41:41,097 --> 00:41:43,025
聪明睿智
You're smart.

697
00:41:43,127 --> 00:41:46,664
收入学历都无可挑剔...
You have ideal income, ideal education...

698
00:41:46,766 --> 00:41:49,735
生活方式 身高体型...
ideal lifestyle, ideal height...

699
00:41:49,837 --> 00:41:52,204
相貌出众 身材健美。
you're good-looking,
you have a great body,

700
00:41:52,306 --> 00:41:53,741
还魅力非凡
you're charming.

701
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:58,607
你生来富有，成长环境优渥，
You were born rich, raised rich,

702
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:00,282
现在依然富有。
you're still rich.

703
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:03,012
你在翠贝卡区拥有顶层公寓。
You own a penthouse in Tribeca.

704
00:42:03,115 --> 00:42:05,048
你可以带女孩来这样的餐厅用餐。
You can take a girl
to a restaurant like this

705
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:09,889
甚至都不算（笑）什么特别场合。
and it's not even (LAUGHS)
like a special occasion.

706
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:14,627
你没有吸毒恶习也不找应召女郎。
You don't have a drug habit
or a call girls habit.

707
00:42:14,729 --> 00:42:16,900
你甚至懂得如何修剪发型，
You even know how to cut your hair,

708
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:18,660
如何得体着装。
and how to dress.

709
00:42:18,762 --> 00:42:20,130
你很有品味。
You have taste.

710
00:42:21,737 --> 00:42:26,536
你在各方面都是满分十分的存在。
You are a 10 out of 10 in every category.

711
00:42:26,638 --> 00:42:28,875
完美无缺。
A complete package.

712
00:42:28,977 --> 00:42:32,674
所以我不明白为何
要在我这样的人身上。
So I don't know why you're
trying to throw it all away

713
00:42:32,776 --> 00:42:33,742
浪费这一切。
on someone like me.

714
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:35,684
什么叫你这样的人？
What's someone like you?

715
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:38,918
就是个普通上班族。
Just a girl who works.

716
00:42:41,086 --> 00:42:43,822
我比你可能约会的对象都要年长。
I'm older than the women
you could be dating.

717
00:42:43,924 --> 00:42:47,595
这意味着我的容貌保质期更短。
Which means my looks won't last as long.

718
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,891
而且我的生育年限所剩无几。
And I have fewer years
left to get pregnant.

719
00:42:49,993 --> 00:42:52,368
如果你娶个25岁的姑娘，
If you marry a 25-year-old,

720
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:55,605
十年后她才会变成我现在的样子。
then in 10 years she'll look like me.

721
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:58,736
如果娶我，十年后
我就会变成我妈那样。
If you marry me, in 10 years
I'll look like my mother.

722
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:00,671
你母亲长什么样？
What does your mother look like?

723
00:43:00,773 --> 00:43:03,643
我出身贫寒，成长环境拮据，
I was born poor, raised poor,

724
00:43:03,745 --> 00:43:06,680
即便现在工作也负债累累。
and even though I work, I have debt.

725
00:43:06,783 --> 00:43:10,180
我是大学辍学生还是失败演员。
I'm a college dropout
and a failed actress.

726
00:43:11,649 --> 00:43:13,950
我没有嫁妆。
I have no dowry.

727
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:16,489
非要说的话，我的嫁妆是负数。
If anything, I have a negative dowry.

728
00:43:16,591 --> 00:43:18,727
我看起来需要嫁妆吗？
Do I look like I need a dowry?

729
00:43:19,928 --> 00:43:23,425
归根结底，这笔账怎么算都不划算。
At the end of the day,
the math doesn't add up.

730
00:43:23,527 --> 00:43:27,362
考虑到你在婚恋市场的条件
和我的处境，
Given your position in the marketplace
and given mine,

731
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,134
我不是适合结婚的对象。
I'm not a girl you marry.

732
00:43:31,707 --> 00:43:34,407
我是那种你只会带回家一次，
I'm a girl that you go home with once,

733
00:43:34,509 --> 00:43:36,371
之后就再也不联系的人。
and then never call again.

734
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:40,947
所以...
So...

735
00:43:41,814 --> 00:43:44,049
你为什么要和我在一起？
what are you doing with me?

736
00:43:48,018 --> 00:43:49,525
你说觉得我聪明，
You say you think I'm smart,

737
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,760
可你说话的方式像在对待原始人。
but you're talking to me
like I'm a caveman.

738
00:43:54,797 --> 00:43:56,297
如果看不到价值我不会和你约会。
I wouldn't date you if I didn't see value.

739
00:43:56,399 --> 00:43:57,564
我和我哥哥不一样。
I'm not like my brother.

740
00:43:57,666 --> 00:43:58,863
我不是在找最温柔漂亮、
I'm not looking for the nicest,

741
00:43:58,965 --> 00:44:01,330
家境优越又喜欢我的女孩。
prettiest rich girl who likes me back.

742
00:44:05,171 --> 00:44:07,142
我要找的是懂游戏规则、
I'm looking for someone
who understands the game,

743
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:08,711
明白世界运转之道的人。
how the world works.

744
00:44:10,207 --> 00:44:12,341
我在寻找让我敬重的人。
I'm looking for someone I respect.

745
00:44:13,315 --> 00:44:14,409
并且信任的人。
And trust.

746
00:44:16,113 --> 00:44:18,149
比我见识更广的人。
Someone who knows more than me.

747
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:22,722
我和你约会不是图物质条件...
I don't want to date you
for your material assets...

748
00:44:22,824 --> 00:44:24,160
虽然我觉得你严重低估了。
though I think you're underselling them

749
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:26,025
自己的这些优势。
by a significant margin.

750
00:44:27,562 --> 00:44:29,127
物质条件根本不值钱，
Material assets are cheap,

751
00:44:30,398 --> 00:44:31,800
它们不会长久。
they don't last.

752
00:44:33,332 --> 00:44:36,970
我想和你在一起
是因为你的无形资产。
I want to be with you
for your intangible assets.

753
00:44:37,936 --> 00:44:39,234
那些才是优质投资。
Those are good investments.

754
00:44:39,336 --> 00:44:41,337
它们不会贬值，只会越来越珍贵。
They don't degrade. They only get sharper.

755
00:44:44,012 --> 00:44:45,873
再说了，我的物质资产足够。
And, besides,
I have enough material assets

756
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,409
我们两个人用。
for the both of us.

757
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,720
我在你身上看到巨大潜力。
I see a lot of potential here.

758
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,222
我觉得我们可以成为绝佳搭档。
I think you and I could make
great partners.

759
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:55,890
希望你也这么认为。
I hope you agree.

760
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:03,663
至于我能为你做些什么...
As for what I can do for you...

761
00:45:03,765 --> 00:45:04,728
我想我是唯一一个这么有钱。
I think I'm the only guy this rich

762
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:06,395
却还能让你不反感的人。
you can actually stand.

763
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:11,702
我喜欢你不是因为你有钱。
I don't like you because you're rich.

764
00:45:11,804 --> 00:45:13,369
那你为什么喜欢我？
Then why do you like me?

765
00:45:17,813 --> 00:45:20,310
因为你让我觉得自己有价值。
Because you make me feel valuable.

766
00:45:27,786 --> 00:45:29,451
你本来就有价值。
You are valuable.

767
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:33,488
这正是我想告诉你的。
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

768
00:45:38,132 --> 00:45:40,495
要不要更认真地交往看看？
Do you want to see
each other more seriously?

805
00:50:05,264 --> 00:50:06,294
我昨晚有点喝多了。
I got kind of drunk last night.

806
00:50:06,397 --> 00:50:08,137
可能没扔进垃圾桶。
I must've missed the trash can.

807
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:09,565
你怎么不扔到你自己的垃圾桶里？
Why don't you throw it out
in your own fucking trash can?

808
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:11,269
我不想让那玩意儿一直摆在房间里。
I don't want it just
sitting there in the room.

809
00:50:11,371 --> 00:50:14,003
为什么不想让你自己的
精液留在房间？
Why don't you want
your own cum in the room?

太他妈恶心了。
It's fucking gross.

811
00:50:15,608 --> 00:50:17,144
所以我们就得在
该死的厨房里看到它？
So we have to deal with it
in the fucking kitchen?

812
00:50:17,246 --> 00:50:19,375
我知道这说不通
老兄，我当时喝醉了。
I know it doesn't
make sense, man, I was drunk.

哈里：好吧。
HARRY: Right.

825
00:51:38,162 --> 00:51:40,591
所以他在梦里要求估值。
So he's asking for
a valuation in his dreams.

826
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:45,968
这是虚高的。
It's inflated.

827
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:49,667
他给我们的现金流折现
完全基于虚构...
He's giving us a DCF
based on pure fiction...

828
00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:54,341
对未来收入流的预测
却无视费用增长。
on future revenue streams with
blinders for expense growth.

829
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:59,476
没错，他是个糟糕的分析师...
Yeah, he's a bad analyst...

830
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:02,184
现在根本就是在胡编乱造。
and he's just making
shit up at this point.

831
00:52:08,953 --> 00:52:11,389
他只是随口编数字。听着...
He's just saying numbers that
come to his head. Listen...

832
00:52:11,492 --> 00:52:13,621
这对我们公司来说
仍是个不错的增长故事...
it's still a good growth
story for our company...

833
00:52:13,723 --> 00:52:15,027
所以我们还得继续。
so we're going to have to continue

ahold of her yet...

849

850
00:53:00,871 --> 00:53:03,573
但我很期待听听你的感受。

真高兴你们相处愉快。
Um, I'm so glad you had a good time.

858
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,060
苏菲确实很优秀。
Sophie is really wonderful.

859
00:53:23,162 --> 00:53:24,461
马克：是啊。
MARK: Yeah, no.

860
00:53:24,563 --> 00:53:26,134
我们聊得特别投机。
Like the conversation just flowed.

861
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:29,268
最后还在外面待到很晚。
Uh, we ended up staying out pretty late.

862
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:31,768
不错啊。那你想再约她吗？
Cool. So, do you want to see her again?

863
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,705
马克：当然。
MARK: Sure.

864
00:53:34,807 --> 00:53:36,609
不过不确定会不会认真发展...
Sure. I'm not sure how serious
it's going to be...

865
00:53:36,711 --> 00:53:39,477
但如果她愿意，我不介意再见她。
but I wouldn't mind seeing
her again, if she's game.

00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:42,444

我们在交往。
I'm dating him.

887
00:54:36,436 --> 00:54:38,101
和我们其他客户约会几次吗？
with some of our clients first?

888

是他坚持的。
He insisted.

维奥莱特：我刚和苏菲的律师通完话。
VIOLET: I just hung up
with Sophie's lawyer.

894
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:03,563
她的律师？
Her lawyer?

895
00:55:04,895 --> 00:55:09,371
据说她在约会中遭到了侵犯。
Apparently, she was assaulted on the date.

896
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:14,772
什么？
What?

897
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:20,781
马克·P干的？
By Mark P.?

898
00:55:20,883 --> 00:55:21,911
维奥莱特：是的。
VIOLET: Yes.

899
00:55:23,985 --> 00:55:25,046
昨晚的事？
Last night?

900
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:27,651
你是认真的吗？
Are you serious?

901
00:55:27,754 --> 00:55:30,392
她起诉的是公司，不是你。
She's bringing charges
to the company, not you.

902
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:32,390
两分钟后我要和法律团队通话...
I have a call with the legal team
in two minutes...

903
00:55:32,492 --> 00:55:33,692
我们会解决这个问题的。
and we're going to figure it out.

904
00:55:34,492 --> 00:55:35,828
我必须和她谈谈。
I need to speak with her.

905
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:37,366
露西，不行。
Lucy, no.

906
00:55:37,468 --> 00:55:40,235
- 维奥莱特，她是我的客户。
- 维奥莱特：现在不是了。
- Violet, she's my client.
- VIOLET: She's not anymore.

907
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,468
如果索菲打电话来，你绝对不能接。
So if Sophie calls, you must not pick up.

908
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:45,733
- 我不能袖手旁观。
- 维奥莱特：就袖手旁观。
- I can't do nothing.
- VIOLET: Do nothing.

909
00:55:45,835 --> 00:55:47,405
根据你掌握的信息。
You made the best match you could

910
00:55:47,507 --> 00:55:49,408
你已经尽力做了最佳匹配。
given the information you have.

911
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,173
这次配对确实出了问题。
This particular match did not work out

912
00:55:51,275 --> 00:55:55,414
但几个月来你为索菲做的
匹配工作一直很出色。
but you've been doing
amazing work for Sophie for months.

913
00:55:55,516 --> 00:55:58,248
不是"出了问题"这么简单，维，
The match didn't "not work out," Vi,

914
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:00,420
她是被侵犯了。
she was assaulted.

915
00:56:00,522 --> 00:56:03,023
媒人无法担保一个人。
A matchmaker can't vouch
for how a person is

916
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:04,324
在亲密场合的表现。
in an intimate setting

917
00:56:04,426 --> 00:56:06,120
因为她从未和他们有过亲密接触。
since she's never been in one with them.

918
00:56:09,728 --> 00:56:12,665
以前发生过类似的事吗？
Has something like this happened before?

919
00:56:14,299 --> 00:56:15,569
当然。
Of course.

920
00:56:16,533 --> 00:56:18,440
这就是约会。
This is dating.

921
00:56:19,474 --> 00:56:20,701
我工作的第三年
This happened to one of my clients

922
00:56:20,803 --> 00:56:23,511
就有客户遇到过这种事。
the third year I worked here.

923
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:26,679
做这行久了，大家都会碰到。
If you do this long enough,
it happens to all of us.

924
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,149
这是已知风险。
It's a known risk.

你好。
Hi.

933
00:57:47,459 --> 00:57:48,761
抱歉我迟到了。
Sorry I'm late.

934
00:57:50,296 --> 00:57:51,533
没关系。
No worries.

935
00:57:52,465 --> 00:57:53,629
我穿得够得体吗？
Am I dressed nice enough?

936
00:57:53,731 --> 00:57:55,999
可能有点太正式了。
You might be dressed too nice.

937
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,339
我的父母相爱了。

走进这家餐厅，正在约会。
I entered this restaurant. I'm on a date.

940
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:08,280
服务员走过来问我。
A waiter walks up to me and asks,

941
00:58:08,382 --> 00:58:09,548
"需要点什么？"。
"What can I do for you?"

942
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:11,151
"不知道，你能提供什么？"。
"I don't know. What can you do for me?"

943
00:58:11,253 --> 00:58:12,781
我点了杯水。
I order a glass of water.

944
00:58:12,883 --> 00:58:14,517
我的父母相爱了。

00:58:22,431 --> 00:58:24,560
我上学读书。
I went to school. I read books.

950
00:58:24,662 --> 00:58:26,026
写过读书报告。
I wrote book reports.

951
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:28,864
我上了更多学。
写了论文。
I went to more school. I wrote essays.

952
00:58:28,966 --> 00:58:30,566
约翰：嗯，确实与众不同。
JOHN: Well, it's certainly different.

我是说，这个，呃...
I mean, it's, it's, uh...

这是段很棒的经历。
我觉得自己很幸运。
It's been a good experience.
I feel really lucky.

955
00:58:36,743 --> 00:58:37,939
听着，认识你们真的很开心。
Listen, it was great to meet you guys.

- MAN: Of course.

957
00:58:45,419 --> 00:58:47,055

958
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:49,253
- 太精彩了。

959
00:58:49,355 --> 00:58:50,851
是的，我非常喜欢。
Yes, I loved it.

演出非常有意思。
Congratulations.
That was really interesting.

963
00:58:57,362 --> 00:58:58,664
谢谢。
Thanks.

964
00:58:58,767 --> 00:59:01,130
真不敢相信你记住了所有台词。
I can't believe you remembered
all those lines.

965
00:59:02,304 --> 00:59:04,639
是啊，简直疯了。
Yeah. Yeah, it's nuts.

966
00:59:07,608 --> 00:59:08,604
听着，我们准备去。
Well, listen, we're going around

你们要一起来吗？
You guys want to come?

00:59:12,412 --> 00:59:14,279
- 好啊。
- 太棒了。
- Yes.
- Great.

970
00:59:14,381 --> 00:59:15,878
- 好的。
- 没问题。
- Okay.
- Yeah.

971
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,545
约翰：说真的，你觉得怎么样？
JOHN: So, what did you really think?

972
00:59:17,647 --> 00:59:19,716
我喜欢。
I liked it.

973
00:59:19,818 --> 00:59:21,852
有些部分不太明白...
Some of it didn't make sense...

974
00:59:21,955 --> 00:59:25,220
但我超爱看你表演，你知道的。
but I loved watching you act,
you know that.

975
00:59:26,261 --> 00:59:27,963
你有怀念过演戏吗？
Do you ever miss it?

976
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:29,328
露西：演戏？没有。
LUCY: Acting? No.

977
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:30,830
一点点都没有？
Not even a little bit?

978
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:34,434
露西：我和你不一样。
LUCY: I'm not like you.

979
00:59:34,536 --> 00:59:36,668
我从来就没想过当演员。
I was never going to be an actor.

980
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:40,939
我连怎么站姿或...说话都不会。
I didn't know how to stand or... speak.

981
00:59:43,808 --> 00:59:45,845
但你一直都很棒。
You were always good though.

982
00:59:46,942 --> 00:59:48,716
现在更出色了。
You're even better now.

01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:04,198
露西：对。
LUCY: Yeah.

987
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,096
他是新郎的弟弟。
He's the groom's brother.

988
01:00:08,505 --> 01:00:10,265
你不会要嫁给他吧？
You're not gonna marry him, are you?

989
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:12,338
为什么不呢？
Why not?

990
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,238
因为他长得帅。
Because he's good-looking.

991
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,611
还很有钱。
And rich.

992
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:17,972
有正经工作。
Has a real job.

993
01:00:18,074 --> 01:00:20,176
估计都不用跟人合租。
Probably doesn't have roommates.

994
01:00:21,779 --> 01:00:23,178
大概也不会整天
Probably doesn't get angry

997
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:35,125
你还好吗？
You okay?

998
01:00:40,434 --> 01:00:42,162
为什么这么问？
Why do you ask?

999
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:45,806
就是...你看起来不太对劲。
Just... you don't seem like you're okay.

1000
01:00:47,473 --> 01:00:48,743
是因为他吗？

这能行吗？
Is it work?

我相信会好起来的。
I'm sure it's gonna be fine.

1005
01:01:06,528 --> 01:01:09,597
你对自己太苛刻了。
You're so hard on yourself.

1006
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:13,600
你又不是无人机驾驶员
或枪支游说者。

我不是这个意思。
That's not what I meant.

from Long Island or New Jersey?

01:02:57,601 --> 01:03:01,608
如果实在找不到再考虑其他种族。
but then if we have no luck,
we can move on to other races.

1038
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:04,075

01:03:08,044 --> 01:03:09,950
埃莉诺"理论上"来说。
Eleanor, "technically,"

1041
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:13,414
你是在让我只给你介绍白人男性。
you're asking me to set you up
with only white men.

1042
01:03:13,516 --> 01:03:16,183
我知道要求很多但我值得拥有。
I know the list looks long
but I deserve someone

1043
01:03:16,285 --> 01:03:18,126
完全符合条件的人。
who fulfills all of my criteria.

1044
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:19,287
真的值得。
I really do.

1045
01:03:19,389 --> 01:03:22,028
看看我我可是抢手货。(轻笑)。
I mean look at me. I'm a catch. (CHUCKLES)

1046
01:03:24,964 --> 01:03:27,965
帕特里夏我知道每单身一年。
Patricia, I know that every year

1047
01:03:28,067 --> 01:03:29,704
你对未来丈夫的期待值。
you go without having a husband...

1048
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:33,809
就会指数级增长。
raises your expectations
for him exponentially.

1049
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:36,942
但这不意味着
你注定会得到理想对象。
But that doesn't mean
that you're due to get one.

1050
01:03:37,045 --> 01:03:39,613
也不代表你可以
定制一个完美丈夫...
And it doesn't mean
that you can customize...

1051
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:42,243
因为这并不是一场模拟游戏。
because this is not a simulation.

1052
01:03:42,345 --> 01:03:44,014
如果我提供的服务。
If the service I was providing you

1053
01:03:44,116 --> 01:03:45,920
是为你定制一个完美男人。
was building you a man then, of course,

1054
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:49,418
我当然可以按照清单打造出符合所有
条件的人选...
I could build you a man with
everything on this list...

1055
01:03:50,524 --> 01:03:52,022
但我做不到。
But I can't.

1056
01:03:52,124 --> 01:03:55,397
因为这不是买车或买房。
Because this is not a car or a house.

1057
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,093
我们谈论的是活生生的人。
We're talking about people.

1058
01:03:57,195 --> 01:04:00,434
人就是人，本性难移。
People are people are people are people.

1059
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:02,263
每个人都带着与生俱来的特质。
They come as they are.

1060
01:04:02,365 --> 01:04:05,539
我能为你争取的最好结果。
And all I can hope to find for you

1061
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:06,939
就是找个你能勉强忍受的男人。
is a man that you can tolerate

1062
01:04:07,042 --> 01:04:10,142
在未来50年里不讨厌你的那种。
for the next 50 years
who likes you at all.

1063
01:04:12,009 --> 01:04:13,574
而你也不是什么抢手货...
And you are not a catch...

1064
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,313
因为你根本不是商品。
because you are not a fish.

1065
01:04:29,061 --> 01:04:31,999
我只是在帮她认清现实。
I was managing her expectations.

1066
01:04:34,067 --> 01:04:36,133
维奥莱特：帕特里夏取消了会员。
VIOLET: Patricia canceled her membership

1067
01:04:36,235 --> 01:04:40,040
还在网上骂我们是骗子机构。
and reviewed us online, calling us a scam.

1068
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:43,107
我们确实是骗子。
We are a scam.

1069
01:04:43,209 --> 01:04:46,647
根本没兑现承诺，不是吗？
We don't give them
what they pay for, do we?

1070
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:50,314
我们许诺给她们真爱。
We promise them love and then...

1071
01:04:50,416 --> 01:04:55,616
结果只安排了和蠢货罪犯的糟糕约会。
we just give them bad dates
with morons and criminals.

1072
01:05:00,789 --> 01:05:04,328
我知道索菲的事让你压力很大。
I know the Sophie L. situation
is still weighing on you.

1073
01:05:08,705 --> 01:05:11,203
红娘职业倦怠很常见。
Burnout is common for matchmakers.

1074
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:13,335
你需要休息。
You need a break.

1075
01:05:13,438 --> 01:05:15,440
该和男朋友去度个假。
You should go on a trip
with your boyfriend.

1076
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:16,912
（嗤笑）
(SCOFFS)

1077
01:05:19,044 --> 01:05:21,312
如果现在停下...
If I take a break right now...

1078
01:05:22,145 --> 01:05:24,149
可能就再也回不来了。
I may never come back.

1079
01:05:24,251 --> 01:05:26,687
维奥莱特：你会回来的
，因为你爱这些客户。
VIOLET: You will,
because you love your clients.

1080
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:29,917
我恨他们。都是些巨婴。
I hate them. They are children.

1081
01:05:30,019 --> 01:05:32,321
我恨透他们了。
I hate them.

1082
01:05:32,423 --> 01:05:34,091
维奥莱特：他们付了上万美元。
VIOLET: They give us thousands of dollars.

1083
01:05:34,193 --> 01:05:36,426
有权表现得幼稚点。
They're entitled to some regression.

1084
01:05:38,295 --> 01:05:41,733
你觉得他们当中
Do you think that any one of them

1085
01:05:41,835 --> 01:05:43,499
有人会对心理医生说...
says to their therapist...

1086
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,303
"不要黑人，不要胖子"吗？
"No Blacks, no fatties"?

1087
01:05:48,405 --> 01:05:50,237
要是我真成了他们的心理医生。
And if I'm their actual therapist,

1088
01:05:50,339 --> 01:05:52,946
虽然现在也差不多了...
which it feels like I am...

1089
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:56,344
我可没受过专业训练。
I don't have the schooling
to support that.

1090
01:05:56,446 --> 01:05:59,086
工资也远远不够。
And I certainly don't get paid enough.

1091
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:04,252
维奥莱特：露西，
我们比心理医生更厉害。
VIOLET: Lucy, we're better
than therapists.

1092
01:06:04,354 --> 01:06:06,823
我们接触的是最私密。
We work with the most intimate...

1093
01:06:06,925 --> 01:06:08,256
最难以启齿的
extremely personal,

1094
01:06:08,358 --> 01:06:09,964
他们人生中见不得光。
unofficial part of their lives...

1095
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:13,660
恨不得彻底删除的部分。
that they'd like to see
struck from the record.

1096
01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:16,763
我们直面他们的孤独与挫败。
We work with their
loneliness and rejection...

1097
01:06:16,865 --> 01:06:20,573
那种让人在陌生人面前脱光的脆弱。
the kind that makes someone
get naked for a stranger.

1098
01:06:20,675 --> 01:06:22,010
我们才是真正的灵魂摆渡人。
We're the real deal.

1099
01:06:22,711 --> 01:06:23,977
所以他们才会告诉你。
That's why they tell you

1100
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,043
连心理医生都不知道的秘密。
more than they would tell their therapists

1101
01:06:26,145 --> 01:06:28,280
以及他们为何愿意为你冒险。
and why they take risks with you.

1102
01:06:30,012 --> 01:06:31,381
"冒险"。
"Risks."

1103
01:06:31,483 --> 01:06:34,150
维奥莱特：没错。那些可能导致
像索菲·L事件的风险。
VIOLET: Yes. Risks that can
lead to a situation

1104
01:06:34,252 --> 01:06:36,550
也可能促成
like what happened with Sophie L.

1105
01:06:36,652 --> 01:06:40,358
相伴终生的婚姻。
And risks that lead to lifelong marriages.

1106
01:06:42,393 --> 01:06:44,796
你知道这份工作能改变人生。
You know this is life-changing work.

1107
01:06:44,898 --> 01:06:46,364
而你天生就该做这个。
And you're born for it.

1108
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:49,366
从现在开始休假吧。
Take a break starting now.

1109
01:06:49,468 --> 01:06:52,733
我希望四周后回来时你能焕然一新。
And I expect you back
in four weeks, renewed.

1110
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:54,367
这是命令。
I insist.

1111
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:56,572
- (欢呼声)- (敲门声)。
- (CHEERING)
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)

1112
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:02,444
萝丝：维奥莱特！天大的好消息！
ROSE: Violet! Amazing news!

1113
01:07:02,547 --> 01:07:06,387
我的客户佐伊·H
和弗雷德·A订婚了！
My client Zoe H.
and Fred A. just got engaged!

1114
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:08,754
(女人们欢呼)
(WOMEN CHEERING)

1115
01:07:08,856 --> 01:07:11,625
维奥莱特：太难以置信了！天啊！
VIOLET: Unbelievable! Oh!

1116
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:14,694
这简直太棒了！
That is so impressive!

1117
01:07:14,796 --> 01:07:16,223
多么完美的一对！
What an amazing match!

1118
01:07:16,325 --> 01:07:17,624
- 第四对了？
- (叹息)
- Number four?
- (SIGHS)

1119
01:07:17,726 --> 01:07:19,797
- 萝丝：没错！
- 我们必须给你办个派对！
- ROSE: Yes!
- We have to throw you a party!

1120
01:07:19,899 --> 01:07:21,668
(女人们尖叫)
(WOMEN SCREAMING)

(男人交谈声)
(MAN CHATTERING)

1124
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:38,674
露西：索菲。
LUCY: Sophie.

1125
01:08:53,289 --> 01:08:55,493
(模糊的交谈声)。
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1126
01:09:12,011 --> 01:09:13,478
(喘息)索菲。
(PANTING) Sophie.

1127
01:09:16,448 --> 01:09:18,111
- 索菲。
- 你不想和我说话。
- Sophie.
- You don't want to talk to me.

1128
01:09:18,213 --> 01:09:19,884
求你了。
Please.

1129
01:09:19,986 --> 01:09:21,486
我太羞愧了。
I am so embarrassed.

1130
01:09:22,486 --> 01:09:23,823
我居然以为花钱雇人。
I thought I could pay some girl

1131
01:09:23,925 --> 01:09:25,556
就能找到真爱。
to find me a boyfriend.

1132
01:09:26,156 --> 01:09:27,290
对不起。
I'm sorry.

1133
01:09:27,392 --> 01:09:29,029
"专家"？
真是天大的笑话。
"An expert"? What a fucking joke.

1134
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:31,899
- 索菲-
- 知道更可笑的是什么吗？
- Sophie-
- You know what's even funnier?

1135
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,031
我差点以为我们成了朋友。
I almost felt like we were friends.

1136
01:09:34,133 --> 01:09:35,900
我...我...我真的...
I, I, I, I really-- I--

1137
01:09:36,002 --> 01:09:37,331
(呼吸颤抖)
(BREATH TREMBLING)

1138
01:09:37,433 --> 01:09:39,372
我们能谈谈吗？
Can we please just talk?

1139
01:09:40,302 --> 01:09:41,572
谈什么？
Talk about what?

1140
01:09:43,043 --> 01:09:44,641
你还有什么可说的？
What do you have to say?

1141
01:09:48,445 --> 01:09:50,317
(叹息，低语)对不起。
(SIGHS, WHISPERING) I'm sorry.

1142
01:09:51,988 --> 01:09:54,189
(正常声音)我真的很抱歉。
(IN NORMAL VOICE) I'm so sorry.

1143
01:09:55,757 --> 01:09:57,786
我曾信任你。
I trusted you.

1144
01:09:59,656 --> 01:10:02,230
我不知道他会做出这种事。
I didn't know what he was capable of.

1145
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:05,694
所以你的意思是...
I see, so...

1146
01:10:05,796 --> 01:10:09,903
你知道他的身高——
顺便说这也是谎报的。
you knew his height,
which was a lie by the way.

1147
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:11,732
还有他的工作和薪水。
And his job and his salary,

1148
01:10:11,834 --> 01:10:13,900
同样也都是假的我得说明白。
which was also a lie just for the record.

1149
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:16,108
还有他那张脸其实也不怎么样...
And his looks, which is
really nothing much...

1150
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:18,312
但你却不了解他的人品。
but you didn't know who he was.

1151
01:10:19,211 --> 01:10:22,843
作为一个人，一个男人。
As a person. As a man.

1152
01:10:22,945 --> 01:10:25,649
我和他约会后才发现。
Well, I went on a date
with him and found out.

1153
01:10:26,749 --> 01:10:28,715
他是那种喝醉酒
He's the kind of guy who gets drunk

1154
01:10:28,817 --> 01:10:31,325
会尾随你进洗手间的人。
and follows you into the bathroom.

1155
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:33,690
（叹气）
(SIGHS)

1156
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:37,694
你怎么能给我介绍这种人？
Why would you set me up
with someone like that?

1157
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:46,571
他条件优秀潜力十足。
He was a strong match
with a lot of potential.

1158
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:53,908
符合我们多项匹配标准。
He checked a lot of our boxes.

1159
01:10:58,885 --> 01:11:00,013
「标准」？
"Boxes"?

1160
01:11:05,525 --> 01:11:07,093
你给我安排这种对象。
The truth is, you set me up with that man

1161
01:11:07,195 --> 01:11:08,762
就是觉得我一文不值。
because you think I'm worthless.

1162
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:10,064
露西：不，我没有——。
LUCY: No, I don't--

1163
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:11,725
你根本不知道该怎么安置我。
You didn't know what to do with me.

1164
01:11:11,827 --> 01:11:13,928
所以才会促成那次约会。
That's how I ended up on that date.

1165
01:11:15,997 --> 01:11:19,239
我还以为你是为我工作...
Here I was thinking that
you worked for me...

1166
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:21,573
结果一直都是我在替你打工。
but the whole time I was working for you.

1167
01:11:23,176 --> 01:11:26,377
滞销商品...
Worthless merchandise...

1168
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:29,317
随便找个接盘的人脱手。
to pawn off to anyone who'd take it.

1169
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:35,785
但我不是商品。
But I am not merchandise.

1170
01:11:37,287 --> 01:11:38,623
我是活生生的人。
I'm a person.

1171
01:11:40,724 --> 01:11:44,624
我知道自己值得被爱。（抽泣）
And I know I deserve love. (SHUDDERS)

1172
01:11:44,726 --> 01:11:47,599
你当然值得，我坚信这点。
I know you do. I believe it.

1173
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:51,306
去你的。
Fuck you.

1174
01:11:52,136 --> 01:11:53,374
皮条客。
Pimp.

1179
01:12:52,396 --> 01:12:53,862

1182
01:13:04,979 --> 01:13:05,974
谢了兄弟。
Thanks, man.

1183
01:13:07,684 --> 01:13:08,680
露西？

1184
01:13:09,612 --> 01:13:11,314
发生什么事？你还好吗？
What's going on? You okay?

1185
01:13:11,416 --> 01:13:14,450
露西：（颤抖）不好。
LUCY: (SHUDDERING) No.

1186
01:13:14,553 --> 01:13:15,984
要我去接你吗？
Do you want me to come get you?

1187
01:13:17,488 --> 01:13:19,193
露西：不用，我在家。
LUCY: No, I'm at home.

1188
01:13:19,295 --> 01:13:21,492
我本不该打给你的。
I shouldn't even be calling you.

1189
01:13:21,594 --> 01:13:25,026
随时都可以找我。怎么了？
You can always call me. What's up?

1190
01:13:26,464 --> 01:13:27,963
露西：我搞砸了。（抽噎）
LUCY: I fucked up. (SOBS)

1191
01:13:31,367 --> 01:13:32,605
没事。
Okay.

1192
01:13:36,576 --> 01:13:39,876
按规定不能告诉别人...
I'm not supposed to tell anybody but...

1193
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:44,518
但能跟你说吗？
can I tell you?

1194
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:47,081
约翰：当然。
JOHN: Of course.

1195
01:13:48,385 --> 01:13:49,589
任何事都可以。
Anything.

1196
01:13:55,529 --> 01:13:59,027
我给客户介绍了人渣。
I set my client up with a bad person.

1197
01:14:01,504 --> 01:14:04,232
当时不知道他品行不端。
I didn't know he was bad,
but I introduced them.

1198
01:14:04,334 --> 01:14:05,539
现在
And now

1199
01:14:07,108 --> 01:14:09,375
我无力挽回。
I can't fix it.

1200
01:14:09,477 --> 01:14:12,711
我是最没资格补救的人。
I'm the last person who can fix it.

1201
01:14:17,285 --> 01:14:19,082
需要我过来陪你吗？
Do you want me to come over?

1202
01:14:19,185 --> 01:14:21,288
露西：不用。
LUCY: No.

1203
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:24,921
不用 我正准备去哈里那儿。
No. I'm about to go to Harry's.

1204
01:14:26,422 --> 01:14:27,660
好吧。
Right.

1205
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:30,090
露西：抱歉。
LUCY: Sorry.

1206
01:14:30,192 --> 01:14:34,134
别这么说 这没什么好道歉的。
No, no. It's... Hey,
nothing to be sorry about.

1207
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:35,932
继续跟我说说发生了什么。
Keep telling me what happened.

1208
01:14:37,301 --> 01:14:38,605
我在这儿呢。
I'm here.

1209
01:14:40,405 --> 01:14:42,609
(流水声)

1210
01:17:11,621 --> 01:17:13,320
(哈里叹息)
(HARRY SIGHS)

1211
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:17,731
你知道这些是什么吗？
Do you know what they are?

1212
01:17:18,562 --> 01:17:19,865
大概知道。
I think so.

1213
01:17:21,569 --> 01:17:23,836
- 不是什么大事- 我明白。
- It's not a big deal.
- I know.

1214
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:28,907
我做了项投资。
I made an investment.

1215
01:17:30,742 --> 01:17:32,040
身体就像一套公寓。
A body is like an apartment.

1216
01:17:32,142 --> 01:17:34,176
必须投入才能获得回报。
You have to invest to get the value back.

1217
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:37,718
我懂你的意思。
I understand you.

1218
01:17:39,353 --> 01:17:40,952
我也投资过。
I invested too.

1219
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:48,388
哈里：嗯 我猜也是。
HARRY: Right. I figured.

1220
01:17:52,928 --> 01:17:55,163
你弟弟也做了？
Did your brother too?

1221
01:17:55,265 --> 01:17:58,904
哈里：对 我们八年前一起做的。
HARRY: Yeah, we did it
together eight years ago.

1222
01:18:02,109 --> 01:18:04,870
夏洛特择偶标准里写着
身高必须超过一米八...
Six feet or taller was one of
Charlotte's non-negotiables...

1223
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:07,242
所以我很庆幸做了手术。
so I'm glad he did.

1224
01:18:09,746 --> 01:18:11,213
当时疼吗？
Was it painful?

1225
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:16,250
我知道听起来很蠢，
I know it sounds stupid,

1226
01:18:16,352 --> 01:18:18,218
打断腿骨就为了增高几厘米。
breaking your legs to gain
a few extra inches.

1227
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,992
但我们一直说绝对值得。
But we keep saying, definitely worth it.

1228
01:18:22,694 --> 01:18:24,259
这改变了我们的人生。
It changed our lives.

1229
01:18:26,294 --> 01:18:29,867
在异性缘方面当然特别明显。
With women, completely, of course.

1230
01:18:29,969 --> 01:18:31,734
现在会有女生主动搭讪，
Women just approach us and talk to us now,

1231
01:18:31,836 --> 01:18:33,433
以前从没这种待遇。
which never happened before.

1232
01:18:35,477 --> 01:18:37,974
从那以后我就没失手过。
I haven't struck out since.

1233
01:18:38,077 --> 01:18:40,339
但你在职场和社交场合。
But you can also tell
the difference at work

1234
01:18:40,441 --> 01:18:43,047
餐厅 机场都能感受到差别。
and at restaurants and airports. You're...

1235
01:18:45,453 --> 01:18:47,084
你就是...更受重视了。
You're just worth more.

1236
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:53,860
这会影响我们吗？
Does this change anything?

1237
01:18:55,998 --> 01:18:56,995
不会。
No.

1238
01:18:58,694 --> 01:18:59,998

1240
01:19:11,843 --> 01:19:13,341
你在想什么？
What are you thinking about?

1241
01:19:15,581 --> 01:19:17,948
我在想...
I'm thinking that...

1242
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:21,349
你应该自己一个人去冰岛。
that you should go to Iceland without me.

1243
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,858
- 为什么？
- (叹息)
- Why?
- (SIGHS)

1244
01:19:28,094 --> 01:19:30,690
我觉得我们并不合适。
I don't think that you and I
are a good match.

1245
01:19:30,792 --> 01:19:32,030
(叹息)
(SIGHS)

1246
01:19:33,327 --> 01:19:35,364
是因为我做过手术？
Is it because I got the surgery?

1247
01:19:35,466 --> 01:19:38,599
不 知道这事反而让我感觉
真正了解了你。
No. Knowing that just makes me
feel like I actually know you.

1248
01:19:38,702 --> 01:19:39,873
那是为什么？
Then what?

1249
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:43,674
我很难不觉得
It's really hard for me to feel like

1250
01:19:43,776 --> 01:19:45,606
这事和你的腿有关。
this is not about the legs.

1251
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:47,207
不是这样的。
It's not.

1252
01:19:47,309 --> 01:19:49,080
当我意识到你的所作所为时。
When I realized what you had done,

1253
01:19:49,182 --> 01:19:53,285
那种感觉和我之前对你的感受完全一样。
it made me feel exactly
how I felt about you before.

1254
01:19:53,387 --> 01:19:54,547
什么感受？
Which is what?

1255
01:19:56,557 --> 01:19:58,287
我并不爱你。
I'm not in love with you.

1256
01:20:01,058 --> 01:20:03,160
你也不爱我。
And you're not in love with me.

1257
01:20:04,999 --> 01:20:08,902
再多的钱也改变不了这个事实。
And there's no amount of money
that can fix that.

1258
01:20:10,231 --> 01:20:12,169
但我们明明很般配。
But we're such a good match.

1259
01:20:13,841 --> 01:20:15,334
你完全符合我的择偶标准...
You're exactly what I'm looking for...

1260
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:17,204
而且我能让你的生活变得更好。
and I know I can make your life better.

1261
01:20:17,306 --> 01:20:20,778
哈利，你并不是想娶我。
Harry, you don't want to marry me.

1262
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,144
你是想和我做生意。
You want to do business with me,

1263
01:20:22,246 --> 01:20:23,946
就像我想和你做生意一样。
just like I want to do business with you.

1264
01:20:24,048 --> 01:20:25,383
但婚姻不就是一桩生意吗？
But isn't marriage a business deal?

1265
01:20:25,485 --> 01:20:26,920
确实如此。
Yes, it is.

1266
01:20:28,382 --> 01:20:30,957
当你真正爱上一个人时就不会了。
But love has to be on the table.

1267
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:49,239
如果我没有爱的能力呢？
What if I'm not capable of it?

1268
01:20:50,575 --> 01:20:51,912
你是说不会爱人？
Of love?

1269
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,949
这让我觉得自己像个白痴。
It makes me feel like an idiot.

1270
01:20:57,649 --> 01:20:58,853
就像个...
Like I'm...

1271
01:21:00,116 --> 01:21:02,656
什么都不懂的...小孩子。
I'm just a clueless... child.

1272
01:21:02,758 --> 01:21:06,520
光是想到爱情...
I feel so... dumb thinking about it...

1273
01:21:07,923 --> 01:21:09,592
或是渴望爱情
or wanting it.

1274
01:21:09,694 --> 01:21:10,997
就让我觉得...
I find it...

1275
01:21:11,993 --> 01:21:13,461
特别困难。
so difficult.

1276
01:21:22,843 --> 01:21:25,310

不需要算计。
No math.

1280
01:21:43,227 --> 01:21:45,900
我该雇佣你的婚介服务吗？
Should I hire you for your services?

1281
01:21:46,997 --> 01:21:48,163
如果你打电话到公司。
If you call the office,

1282
01:21:48,265 --> 01:21:50,465
他们会为你安排最优秀的顾问。
they'll assign someone great for you.

1284
01:21:57,742 --> 01:21:59,177

So this is it?

1285
01:22:14,323 --> 01:22:16,227
你想知道我长高了多少英寸？

六英寸。

你原来只有5尺6寸？
You were 5'6" before?

1289
01:22:40,449 --> 01:22:41,851
要是只有这个身高。
I wouldn't have had the confidence

1290
01:22:41,953 --> 01:22:44,090
我可没自信来搭讪你。
to hit on you at 5'6".

1291

你肯定会的。
I'm sure you would have.

01:22:52,568 --> 01:22:54,397
我还是你的独角兽吗？
Am I still a unicorn?

你不想和我在一起是因为我人品不好。
You don't want to be with me
